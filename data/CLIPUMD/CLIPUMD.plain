# ::snt "It is not very intelligent to chase terrorists down the Afghan mountains or central Asia," Gadhafi said in the hour-long speech.

# ::id apw_eng_20090611_0697.9
# ::snt Sarcastically, he asked, "What's the difference between the U.S. airstrikes on our homes and bin Laden's actions?"

# ::id apw_eng_20090611_0697.10
# ::snt If anything, he said, bin Laden is an outlaw, while the United States is a country that should abide by international law.

# ::id apw_eng_20090611_0697.11
# ::snt Former President Ronald Reagan ordered airstrikes on Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986 after an attack on a disco in Germany killed three people, including two U.S. servicemen.

# ::snt Gadhafi had long been ostracized by the West for sponsoring terrorism, but in recent years sought to emerge from his pariah status by abandoning weapons of mass destruction and renouncing terrorism in 2003.

# ::id apw_eng_20090611_0697.15
# ::snt Libya has since agreed to pay compensation to the families of the Berlin disco victims as well as the families of the victims of the 1988 Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people, including 189 Americans.

# ::id apw_eng_20090611_0697.23
# ::snt Enrico Morando, a senator of the opposition Democratic Party, said Gadhafi's presence at the Senate would have been a "humiliation of this country's democratic and republican spirit."

# ::snt But it appears the prosecution struck a deal because of a lack of evidence.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787556_0036.12
# ::snt It seems the prosecutor is saying that everyone involved was drunk/drinking and that the stories told had holes in them.......

# ::snt That said, young men should also not put themselves in that exact same situation because if you can't recount accurately what happened because you were drunk, you cannot say for sure what did or did not happen.

# ::snt It's a horrible thing that happened.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787556_0037.4
# ::snt Well then, why is it a HATE CRIME when a White person does it to a Black but not a HATE CRIME when it's the other way around?

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787556_0037.5
# ::snt I don't think it is a race issue either.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787556_0037.7
# ::snt Although you do make a good point that it's only a hate crime if a white person picks on a black person.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787556_0037.8
# ::snt If it's the other way around it's no big deal for some reason.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787556_0052.2
# ::snt The girl was just 16, a cheerleader at Silsbee High School in Texas.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787556_0052.3
# ::snt She was at a party in 2008 when football star Rakheem Bolton, fellow player Christian Roundtree and another boy pushed her into a bedroom and locked the door, held her down, and sexually assaulted her...

# ::snt They told her to avoid the cafeteria and not take part in homecoming.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8787556_0054.19
# ::snt So yes, the title of this thread does kind of bend reality.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810379_0020.1
# ::snt Labour are a left wing socialist party.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810379_0020.2
# ::snt They are pro immigration if it supports the economy and believe in equal rights for all individuals.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810379_0020.3
# ::snt They are traditionally more likely and are known for allowing immigrants into the country - hence they were his target.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810379_0020.4
# ::snt The labour party was responsible for the current state of immigration in the country, and in his own ideology, he wanted to take our future labour politicians (which those in the camp were potentially) from getting into power and allowing more in.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810379_0020.5
# ::snt In his mind, by taking them out, he can prevent future immigration.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810379_0020.6
# ::snt can't believe it, norway is such a friendly quiet country, this guy must be nuts they dont even have that many migrants, at least not compared to UK!

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810379_0021.1
# ::snt He basically hates Islam and believes that Islamic immigration is a huge threat to Europe.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810379_0021.2
# ::snt He thinks that European politicians are allowing the colonisation of Europe by Muslims and so are all legitimate targets.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810379_0021.3
# ::snt He thinks we need to deport all Muslims from Europe Turkey North Iran and Palestine.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810379_0021.4
# ::snt He attacked his own kind because killing Muslims would lead to them being replaced by more Muslims.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810379_0021.5
# ::snt So instead he decided to take out "the next generation of Left wing seeds".

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810379_0021.6
# ::snt In short he has wiped out a number of potential future left wing politicians.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810379_0021.7
# ::snt He also sees himself a bit like a templar knight defending Christianity from Islam

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810379_0021.8
# ::snt This.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810379_0021.9
# ::snt He isn't a White Supremacist though.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810379_0022.2
# ::snt This is a bit of a myth. Oslo is a hugely multicultural and as far as I'm aware, Norway as a whole is about on par with the UK in terms of different ethnic groups.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810379_0022.3
# ::snt It's a myth British people seem to have that the UK is one of the most multicultural places in Europe, when in reality Sweden, the Netherlands and possibly Norway are notably more so.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.1
# ::snt I'm not a fan of David Cameron.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.2
# ::snt Thanks to his government, I'll likely be paying 3x as much as I would for university.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.3
# ::snt I voted Labour yesterday, I am a Labour party member, with Scottish roots.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.4
# ::snt However, David Cameron *does* have a say, as do I, as do all of us, on whether we want the Union to remain.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.5
# ::snt David Cameron is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.6
# ::snt He has every right, and indeed, it should be his job to defend and persuade the Scottish electorate and population that the United Kingdom should remain, that Scotland should vote no to any such referendum.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.7
# ::snt I would vote no.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.8
# ::snt The world is changing, with a strengthening east and a weakening west.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.9
# ::snt If the UK were to split, we would all become weakened.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.10
# ::snt I agree, Scottish independence is a matter for the Scots, and should they vote for it, then that vote should be respected.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.11
# ::snt But, personally, I believe rather than a breakup, the union should be reformed, so there is equality for all the nations.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.12
# ::snt Bit of an off point - but I'll just say the 'West Lothian' question and leave you with that.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.13
# ::snt You argue that David Cameron should not be able to 'poke his big nose in' to the idea of Scottish independence - yet, Scottish MPs are able to do just that when certain English affairs are debated in Westminster (something English MPs are not able to do with Scottish affairs).

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.14
# ::snt This is why there should be an appetite for reform within the Union - not a messy divorce that will leave us weakened, not strengthened.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.15
# ::snt I don't agree that Scottish should have a voice in Westminster concerning England-only matters.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.16
# ::snt Indeed, it would be far more pragmatic if we devolved the entire union -a parliament for every 5 or 10 million people in England perhaps?

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.17
# ::snt (North/Midlands/London/South east/west?)

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.19
# ::snt I'm sure there wouldn't be as much appetite for independence north of the border if the Scots felt that they weren't subordinate to a parliament situated hundreds of miles away that doesn't really represent them (Holyrood is overwhelmingly full of centre-left MSPs, yet we effectively have a centre right majority government in Westminster).

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.20
# ::snt I'm not necessarily for or against independence.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.21
# ::snt I haven't really read into it enough to decide.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0094.22
# ::snt I fully support the decision to go independent though, if that is the outcome of the referendum, just as I would support the decision to remain in the union.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.1
# ::snt I'm not Polish.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.2
# ::snt That was my point.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.3
# ::snt My grandfather settled in the Falkirk area of Scotland after the second world war (having served alongside British armed forces during the liberation of Europe).

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.4
# ::snt I have Polish ancestry, the same way Cameron has Scottish ancestry.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.5
# ::snt The idea that Cameron's ancestry should entitle him to vote on matters concerning the Scottish parliament is as ludicrous as my ancestry entitling me to vote in the Polish Sejm.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.6
# ::snt The argument that since Cameron is the prime minister of the UK, he should have a voice is more legitimate, but it is not an argument I agree with.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.7
# ::snt And if Brittany wished to split, that is an issue for those living in Brittany.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.8
# ::snt If Sarkozy isn't from Brittany, then his only job should be in ensuring that the split occurs legally.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.9
# ::snt The argument that the whole of the UK should vote on Scotland's independence is like saying the whole of the EU should get to vote if the UK ever holds an in/out Eu membership referendum.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.10
# ::snt It's completely absurd and there's no justification for it.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.11
# ::snt And what's to say Scotland will go bankrupt?

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.12
# ::snt Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Austria, Switzerland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and Ireland all have population sizes comparable to or smaller than Scotland, and all function well as independent states.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.13
# ::snt The Nordic countries have some of the strongest economies in the world, as does Switzerland.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.14
# ::snt And the Irish economy was, until recently, booming.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.15
# ::snt Iceland is a very interesting example.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.16
# ::snt No major heavy industry, a population a little · over 1/3 of a million, universal healthcare and education (free at university level at state universities) and yet it manages to maintain one of the highest standards of living (arguably the highest) in the world.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.17
# ::snt Claiming that Scotland would go bankrupt in no time is ridiculous.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.18
# ::snt It is entirely possible that Scotland could follow the Nordic example if it ever decides to vote for independence.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.19
# ::snt People forget that Edinburgh is a reasonably large financial centre (relatively large for a country of 5 million) and that central Scotland was a cradle for the industrial revolution.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.20
# ::snt Add to that revenue from hybrocarbon extractions in the north sea, fishing exports, and the ability to become reasonably self-sufficient in renewable energy (wind, tidal, hydroelectric -there's potential for it on Scotland's rugged landscape) and I see no reason why Scotland would be unable to function as an independent nation.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.21
# ::snt Apologies for misunderstanding your nationality.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.22
# ::snt I think the difference with Scotland to those Nordic economies is that Scotland's current expenditure is higher than it would be ovule were to split.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.23
# ::snt It is enormously dependent on the support of the whole of the UK.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.24
# ::snt It would have to scrap free university fees, it wouldn't have the NHS, thus UK infrastructure employs many Scots.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.25
# ::snt If it wasn't to go bankrupt it would certainly struggle for decades.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.26
# ::snt The EU example just isn't the same at all.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3811676_0095.27
# ::snt The EU is not a country that actively supports each other economically (other than bailouts) as much as a country does, it isn't as socially connected, it employs an extremely small percentage of people, they aren't politically connected and have no national identity.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0066.1
# ::snt You're an idiot.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0066.2
# ::snt Loads of "far right" parties advocate high taxes, why?

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0066.3
# ::snt Because it's based on jealousy.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0066.4
# ::snt Poor white folks blame their own poverty on the rich.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0066.5
# ::snt Hitler had an extensive welfare state, the BNP would punish the bankers to the point of destroying what is quite possibly the only real money maker the UK has.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0066.6
# ::snt Lol banking is the only real money maker the UK has...

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0066.7
# ::snt well firstly that isn't true and secondly they pay a pathetically small amount of taxes anyway so provide next to nothing to this country.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0067.3
# ::snt They pay a small percent by the overage sum is huge.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0067.4
# ::snt Where else does the money the government spend come from?

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0068.1
# ::snt Do you really think that the West would lose to a bunch of countries that hate their own neighbours?

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0068.2
# ::snt India and Pakistan hate each other and then there is China who hate both.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0068.3
# ::snt The Middle East would just be destroyed if it was a total war.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0068.4
# ::snt If anything, the 'arrogance' would increase as a result.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0068.5
# ::snt There is no way in hell that NATO would lose to those countries.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0068.6
# ::snt Pakistan is no match for India now.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0068.7
# ::snt And in the future Pakistan will be a mere annoyance than a real threat.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0068.8
# ::snt China and India may have their differences, but they'll never go to war with each other.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0068.9
# ::snt They both stand to lose too much in the process.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0068.10
# ::snt China is already wrapping a fist around the West's balls by buying up their debt and forcing the west to be economically dependent on them.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0068.11
# ::snt Very smart those Chinese.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0068.12
# ::snt India should eventually get in on the act, while weaning themselves off western investment, then when the time is right, they should use economic warfare to plunge western economies into chaos, crippling their financial power, and ultimately their military power.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0068.13
# ::snt After a few months so the West will be very vulnerable.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3812122_0068.14
# ::snt We've had to endure your cr*p for generations.

# ::id bolt-eng-DF-200-192451-5796135_0085.20

# ::id nyt_eng_20130426_0143.5
# ::snt That weekend I learned two important things about Jones: that there was very little distance between him and his songs, and that the same qualities that made him a great artist also made his life a torment.

# ::id nyt_eng_20130426_0143.6
# ::snt In those days he was still unashamedly carrying a torch for Wynette, who had left him because, as she put it in legal papers she filed, he “drinks to such an extent that he becomes completely and absolutely unmanageable.”

# ::id nyt_eng_20130426_0143.7
# ::snt On stage that weekend, he reworked songs like “She Thinks I Still Care” and “Picture Me Without You” so that they included references to her, making them almost embarrassingly personal, as if she were in the audience and he was singing only to her.

# ::id nyt_eng_20130426_0143.8

# ::id nyt_eng_20130426_0143.9
# ::snt He was dressed in a flashy leisure suit and wore a pair of glittering diamond rings on his left hand, including one with his initials, but as he talked about Wynette and how much he still loved her, he began to weep.

# ::id nyt_eng_20130426_0143.10
# ::snt I don’t think he was drunk.

# ::id nyt_eng_20130426_0143.11

# ::id nyt_eng_20130426_0143.12
# ::snt Within a year or two, he would develop a cocaine habit that would send his career off the rails, but there was no sign of that either.

# ::id nyt_eng_20130426_0143.15
# ::snt But Jones wasn’t ashamed or embarrassed by that display, and when he went back to the stage for a second set of what he described to me as “sad, sloppy tear-jerkers,” his singing was even more passionate and inspired, with his twangy, somewhat nasal voice cracking in all the right places with what had to be genuine feeling, not artifice.

# ::id nyt_eng_20130426_0143.16
# ::snt Over a career that lasted nearly 60 years, Jones recorded more than 100 albums, and over and over again, he didn’t just sing the songs that were given to him.

# ::id nyt_eng_20130426_0143.17
# ::snt In the best of his recordings, as on that night, he also inhabited them, so that anyone listening to him could be sure: He really means it, he has really lived this song about heartbreak or hangovers and knows what it means, poor soul.

# ::id nyt_eng_20130426_0143.19
# ::snt But seeing George Jones live for the first time that cold night in southern Maryland was a revelation, because in his own highly idiosyncratic way he showed himself to be no less soulful a singer than Howlin’ Wolf on something like “How Many More Years” or Otis Redding on “I’ve Been Loving You Too Long.”

# ::id nyt_eng_20130426_0143.32
# ::snt But he was, hands down, a superior singer, a fact obvious to everyone in the country music field: As Waylon Jennings once sang, “If we all could sound like we wanted to, we’d all sound like George Jones.”

# ::id nyt_eng_20130426_0143.33

# ::id nyt_eng_20131029_0042.3

# ::snt I was a Gamesmaker for the London 2012 games, and basically as a "Games Graduate" i went for a interview on Monday at a Jobcentre In London, Now i have a previous conviction which i was not convicted of, i was mistaken for someone but i was found guilty for 7 months until it was appealed at the high court; now they made me do a CRB check but will this come up on a Government CRB?

# ::id web1-eng-DF-225-195996-5376307_0001.5
# ::snt or do you think it might be just a basic one?

# ::id web1-eng-DF-225-195996-5376307_0001.6

# ::id web1-eng-DF-225-195996-5376307_0003.2
# ::snt As an ex-employer I had to have CRB checks done for all my staff and many had convictions, it is up to the discretion of the employer how serious the convictions are to them and their business - I can't see from what you have said how this 'conviction' would be held against you.

# ::id web1-eng-DF-225-195996-5376307_0004.1
# ::snt Long as you wasn't acquited due to a technicality and it's just you who's claiming to be mistaken for someone else, then it's all good.
