Braawwk !
Braawwkkk !
It did n't take long .
Route 288 , the circumferential highway running around the south - western quadrant of the <ORGANIZATION>Richmond New Urban Region</ORGANIZATION> , opened in late <DATE>2004</DATE> .
Already it is changing development patterns for the worse and causing localized traffic congestion around its exits .
The <ORGANIZATION>Richmond Times</ORGANIZATION> - Dispatch tells the tale today about the impact on the <ORGANIZATION>Huguenot Trail</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Powhatan County</LOCATION> .
Traffic has more than doubled in one section of Huguenot Trail since 288 opened , reports Will Jones .
Speeding and accidents have surged as well :
17 accidents have been reported near the intersection of Winterfield Road so far this year , up from 12 for all of <DATE>2004</DATE> .
<PERSON>Dale Totten</PERSON> , resident engineer for the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION> , noted that VDOT would four - lane the road for about <MONEY>$ 13 million</MONEY> if it had more money .
Of course , VDOT has no more money for road construction in the <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> region .
One reason is that VDOT , at the behest of local politicians and boosters , spent all its friggin ' money on 288 !
Where 's <PERSON>Homer Simpson</PERSON> when you need him ?
This is a major " D'oh ! " moment .
As we predicted , Route 288 is generating residential development in scarcely populated areas all around its exits , overtaxing the local country roads .
While the limited access highway might provide limited traffic relief for people driving back and forth between <ORGANIZATION>Chesterfield</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Goochland</LOCATION> counties , other people are making choices about where they live and work ,
and they are creating traffic congestion in new places .
The only thing that surprises me is how rapidly this is happening .
Even I thought there might be a lag of three or four years .
If Route 288 has already created a <MONEY>$ 13 million</MONEY> road - construction in just this one exist , think of the liability it has created for all of its exits !
Here 's another prodiction :
After a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval of mega - commercial projects at major 288 intersections , the need for new road improvements will soar .
Before the end of the decade , we may well see the unfunded liability zoom well past the original <MONEY>$ 400 million</MONEY> it took to build the original highway .
To the brainiacs who thought Route 288 was such a great idea :
Thanks for nothing .
I think we could have spent the <MONEY>$ 400 million</MONEY> better elsewhere .
I do n't think you can blame 288 for creating those people .
If there enough of them to create new traffic congestion in new places , then what is the alternative ?
Additional traffic congestion in old places ?
Now you understand how people like TMT in <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> feel .
I 'd usually take the pro - road position -
but with the glaring needs in other parts of the state , 288 was definitely excess ...
You have a city , <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> , that has virtually no traffic .
The rush hour is 30 minutes long ...
And you give them a beltway through a largely rural area .
A road to no where ...
Just think if this money had been spent on another potomac crossing or road improvements that are desperately needed in NOVA ?
<LOCATION>Virginia Centrist</LOCATION> , To add insult to injury , the rest of the state helped pay for 288 in last year 's budget deal -- wiped the slate clean of debt .
It was very nice of y'all to oblige us .
Did n't make much sense , though .
It 's the same old problem .
If you get out ahead of the need you are accused of causing sprawl .
If you build where the need is already acute , then the claim is you ca n't pave your way out of congestion .

That 's a fair point .
5:26 makes a good point .
However , this situation hammers home the validity of the state auditor 's report finding that the <LOCATION>CTB</LOCATION> and VDOT fail to fund transportation projects based on a comprehensive state transportation plan , but rather , based on whoever does the best job of lobbying .
I submit that this is a disgraceful situation that should not be tolerated .
Moreover , <PERSON>Senator Chichester</PERSON> and his toadies would make this worse by pouring more money into this flawed institution .
What is the purpose of transportation - related expenditures ?
In <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , it 's to benefit private business plans and not to serve the public interest .
You all are dead wrong .
No less than <PERSON>Walter Stoch</PERSON> stated that 288 money was intended to be paid from economic development money .
Come on folks !!
TMT : I do n't understand your point .
when was the last time you were stuck in traffic that you were n't on your way to or from some sort of business ?
It seems to me that the whole point of roads is to facilitate the public interest in getting to and from private businesses .
Then , of course there is the <DATE>sunday</DATE> drive , the trip to grandma 's , and the soccer games , but still , the overwhelming need is to support business .
Since our road expenditures nowhere near match the increase in business or state domestic product , it is no wonder we suffer congestion problems .
If we recognize that roads primaarily benefit businesses then we should do two things :
let business pay for more of our transportation bill , ( which they will pass to us , of course ) and incentivize them to locate where they put the least stress on the system , even if that means more overall travel .
Why is it so hard to understand ?
The solution is functional human settlement patterns and a balance between transport system capacity and land use generated travel deman .
All else is spin .

TMT said " In <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , it 's to benefit private business plans and not to serve the public interest . "
I do n't see the point of this statement because it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else .
I think they are so tightly intertwined that they are virtually one and the same .
Obviously there are local problems because this cookie dough is lumpy ,
but in the aggregate if we demonize business long enough we will eventually find out we all work for the Devil .
I do n't see there is any point in claiming as " a solution " a balance that is dynamic and ever changing in nature .
Even you see rail to <LOCATION>Dulles</LOCATION> as a positive because <LOCATION>Dulles</LOCATION> is a job center that promotes bi - directional demand on the rail .
I agree .
In fact that may be sufficient reason to build it , all by itself .
All I 'm saying is that the exact same logic should apply to roads :
hey should have destinations at both ends in order that we get maximum use out of our investment :
we need more places in order to get closer to the balance you say we need .
Reality check here -
I drive past <PERSON>Watkins</PERSON> Landing every morning and evening .
I commute back and forth to work on the <ORGANIZATION>Huguenot Trail</ORGANIZATION> .
I 've never seen anything remotely resembling a " flood " of traffic .
It 's a 55 mph zone - <DATE>75</DATE> to 100 cars in " a morning " - over how much time ?
The Huguenot Trail road widening was already planned , due to the heavy demands of development on the Chesterfield side , the new schools , and a whole bunch of existing developments that were zoned years ago and at that time funneled through Robious Road .
288 , for those of us that actually use it , is wonderful - instead of Powhatan and <ORGANIZATION>Western Chesterfield</ORGANIZATION> being bottlenecked by lack of roads ,
we can actually get some commercial development and have the ability to work closer to where we live .
You may think that 's not rational land use .
I have no desire to live in any city ,
I will not work in a downtown area ,
I will not use mass transit , which is not safe for female commuters that work long and irregular hours ,
and I happen to LIKE large lot development .
How exactly I 'm supposed to keep horses on a 1/4 acre lot is beyond me .
Gas could go to <MONEY>$ 10</MONEY> a gallon
and I 'd still pay to live in the country .
Many people have legitimate preferences - horses , hunting , gardening , certain types of small business - that makes them NOT want to live in an urban core .
This infatuation with city living truly baffles me .
Anonymous 6:37 , You have every right to live in the country if that 's where you wish to live .
But you do n't have a right to have the rest of the state to underwrite construction of a <MONEY>$ 400 million</MONEY> highway to make it easier to shop and get to work .
What 's consistently overlooked in the debate ovre 288 is what else that <MONEY>$ 400 million</MONEY> could have been spent on .
How much traffic congestion could have been alleviated had the money been applied to other pressing road projects or , god forbid , even non - road projects .
<PERSON>Ray Hyde</PERSON> - My comments were directed at investors who lobby to place roads near where they own property and the incompetent system that funds these requests without regard to their link or lack thereof to a master transportation plan .
