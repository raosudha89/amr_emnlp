I am 24 and a mother of a 2 and a half year old .
Me and my son 's father have been broken up since August .
I want to start dating other people and my son 's father says if I do he will have nothing to do with his son .
He is very possesive and controlling but he has no right to be as we are not together .
He has too much going on in his life right now and he thinks we can work when I have told him several times I dont love him and he does not love me .
I want him to be there for his son without needing me too .
But he has no one his family and him dont get along and have their own issues .
I do n't want to be miserable anymore and the longer he is around the more miserable I will be .
I dont want him to not be there for his son as he is a good father or he at least tries .
I do believe every child needs both parents weather they are together or not .
But he thinks if he cant have me no one can .
What do I do to move on with my life .
Your ex is threatening you using your son ... bad , bad , bad .
You ca n't give in to that or it will just escalate .
You have a right to live your own life and be happy , so do n't cave to his threats .
If he really loves his son , he 'll see him regardless , but this is just a typical control method that people like him use .
Others say things like , " I 'm going to kill myself if you leave me " ... get it ?
Date .
Meet all kinds of people .
Do what you want .
If the price is , he voluntarily walks out of both of your lives , you 're probably better off without him .
I 'd agree - one other thing it is none of his business whether you date or not .
I would n't tell him .
Not because of his threat - but because your personal life is none of his business .
Can you document his threats ?
You really need to .
Quit taking his calls , make him leave voice mail .
Make him email or text you .
Keep those records .
Get a lawyer and get a divorce .
If you ca n't afford one , try legal aid .
Tell your ex that all communication needs to go through the lawyer .
The bus drivers want exact change , the till people want exact change , the people who deliver your food want exact change ...
Do they not realise that you do n't get piles of change from the bank ,
someone somewhere is going to have to take the notes ?
People are getting lazy .
I do like to get as near as possible as i woud n't like to be couting coppers all day
ake a GBP 20 note on the bus , they just tell you to get on cos theyre lazy as hell
its illegal to pay certain amounts in loads of coins . such as you can only pay something like 30pence in 1ps
Hello I started university in September , did n't immediately gel with it obviously like most people .
However , I knew it would take me some time to adjust , because I have always been very introverted , and shy and especially anxious and all the rest of it .
The first night I was here , all my housemates and I went out and it was the hardest thing I have ever ever had to do .
To go into the SU bar on my own , sober .
Anyways more to the point ; Here are the facts :
- I am not enjoying university having been here 5months or so ; I 'm disillusioned by the course , not enjoying the projects set , and I do n't like the course delivery as much .
The University made out it was much better than it seems .
- I had a bad start to the first term ; student finance was delayed , adding to my stress levels , I was so worried I was unable to progress with work , conclusively it all piled up .
- I was assigned a counselor through the university ; had seen her for about 5-6weeks ( block sessions ) , if I 'm honest it did n't really work ; because I was never open with her .
Only half - halfheartedly .
- Now the work - load is up to my neck , I have major deadlines to hit , I am depressed , the anxiety is resulting in me feeling miserable all the time .
In no longer have a counselor because you can only have them for so many sessions at a time , and I doubt it will help much this time , if it has n't already .
- I lack motivation , do n't feel comfortable with any of my lecturers , feel like I want to give in , but ca n't bring myself to it , because I will end up in a dead end job , and I aspired to ' be someone ' .
- I would rather be dead than not be educated , and live a life I want to live ( and dropping out of uni would make matters worse ) .
- I 'm 21yrs old ( turn 22 this year ) , do n't have much time left for failing need to do something .
I failed college once over , did another course so I could get to uni do n't want to go through the system over and over and consistently fail .
Can someone please give me some advice please ?
Perhaps go and see your doctor , and see if there 's any way you can get your deadlines extended to try and ease the pressure a bit ?
Send your tutors a similar email to this post ( do n't worry they 've seen it all before - some much more uncomfortable admissions too - I know as I used to work in a Uni Dept admin ) and they will consider mitigating circumstances .
Break your work into manageable chunks .
Concentrate on one bit of work at a time ( obvs the most urgent assignment first ) .
Do n't shut yourself off from your housemates , and well done for trying new things from the very beginning now keep at it !
I 'd reccomend you go and see your doctor too .
If you 've always been an anxious person you might benefit from speaking to someone ( my friend got therapy on the NHS for anxiety , so its really normal ) .
And try and get deadlines extended , if you 're honest I 'm sure your uni will allow it .
It 's getting hard to keep strong and keep carrying on with life .
My mum is getting divorced - she had a horrible time with my step - father and her new found freedom has sent her round the bend .
She 's epileptic and a manic depressive with a huge anger problem .
She 's horrible to me , constantly .
I ca n't cope with her outbursts and nasty hateful remarks when I 'm at home .
I 'm 18 , a full - time sixth former at a high pressure private school ( on a 95 % bursary ) and I 'm at breaking point .
I ca n't do work at home , because she shouts at me .
So then my teachers get angry at me .
One minute she 's lovely , and it 's like having my mummy back , then the next , she turns into the most spiteful human alive .
I 'm not going to pass my A 2 exams , I 've already accepted defeat , that this year of my life is going to make me a failure .
Maybe I can come back from this , who knows . I 've got the most amazing university offers , but I ca n't even accept them - I 'll never make the grades .
I wish I could wipe her out of my life - things would be so much better without her .
But then , I think I 'm just being selfish .
But surely , my life is n't meant to be like this ?
It should be so much better . B
ut I feel as if I have no control over this downhill spiral .
And I do n't know what to do .
Thanks for reading .
It 's nice to vent .
You ca n't get her sectioned for that .
Does she even have a history of mental illness or a diagnosis ?
You do n't know for sure that you wo n't get good grades so accept places if you can .
Life throws * * * * at you all the time .
If it 's not someone in your family , it 's an outsider .
I had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad for a long 8 years before I came to uni and honestly , the only reason why I 'm here is because it was the only way out .
Work hard if you really want out .
Really sounds like you need support from somewhere else if she ca n't give it to you consistently .
You could call Childline or something similar ?
You could go to the library on saturdays and do a good 8 hours of studying there .
Is there a friend 's house you could go to - form a study group ?
So you want her sectioned cos she is a bit of a pain in the arse and you 've blamed all your problems on her ?
I know what you 're feeling .
My Mum was spat out of hell too .
I highly recommend taking up smoking
Oh grow up tsr and stop negging its was a joke !!!
I think over the last year or 2 i 've become a much weaker person and in a way have dulled down my personality inorder to try and make some friends at uni .
But being overly - nice to people has lead them to believe that they can say or do whatever the hell they want to me ...
hey show absolutely no respect .
e.g. i 'll say hello to someone from uni and they 'll ignore me , but 30 minutes later they 'll decide they want my help with some work ... and i 'll give it to them .
It 's causing alot of anger and distress in my life and is really starting to effect my concentration in uni .
has anyone got any experience in handling this sort of thing or how to go about gaining some respect again ?
Just say no.
Do it gradually if it 's not something you 're particularly comfortable with .
You could start with ' No , sorry but I 'm busy '
Of course , do n't go over the top with it lest you go in completely the opposite direction .
If , in your mind , you 're thinking no - say it .
When they start to realise that you 're not going to bend over backwards for them , they 'll start respecting you more .
well this is such a bad attitude really , of course you can be respected if you 're nice but not to the point where you just let them do anything to you , that 's not being nice it 's being a fool .
I do n't know if anyone will read this , but I just feel desperate and feel the need to tell someone .
This September I left home , and started at University . I was incredibly anxious about doing this , but rather delayed thinking about it until I got here ! Now I 'm here , and have been for over two weeks , I feel terribly overwhelmed by it all and feel unintelligent and socially awkward .
I have been struggling emotionally for the majority of my life since moving to Secondary School , although I did lose my dad at around the age of 9 and always used to blame that for my feelings . I have had two periods of counselling in my life , over roughly 15 months from December 2009 until around March this year .
I feel at the moment like the problems in my life are incredibly overwhelming , and are making me ever more doubtful of my always low self - esteem . I have no ability to concentrate on work , often find myself becoming very quiet in social occasions , and doubt myself over anything and everything .
Neither of my counsellers have diagnosed me with depression , and both have suggested I do not suffer from it , but it is a huge worry to me , as depression was the cause of my dad 's death , suicide .
I have tried to solve my problems before , and have found exercise and meditation particularly useful , and have also tried things like self - help books and tapes . But my general feeling , is , ' Is this what my life will be ? My one chance at existance , my one chance of being a young man , I am wasting it ! ' And these feelings are beating away at me .
I simply do n't know what to do , and when I think of things to do , I never follow through with it . Friends often say I 'm lazy , and I ca n't disagree a lot of the time . I feel like everything anyone could do to help , people have tried , and time and time again I fail .
Sorry to anyone whose read this jumbled mess , and I feel a bit like a self - seeking moaner , but I truly do feel desperate .
Its not uncommon for people 's existing feelings about themselves to become more intense when they are in new situations and feel the pressure to socialise with strangers and fit into new roles , i.e. being a university student .
I am not a health professional and I can only speak from personal experience which is why I strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional about your feelings and worries about depression .
Most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they first get to uni - you 're definitely not alone there . But I would really recommend that you get an appointment with your uni counselling services . It does n't really matter whether anyone has told you that you are depressed or not , you are obviously having some problems at the minute and could use some support - labels are n't as important as your experiences . Meditation and exercise are really helpful , so definitely try to do those . But yeah , you will have to engage with help and life in general to get somewhere - but do n't beat yourself up about feeling unmotivated to do anything at the minute , lots of people feel like this and hopefully it will pass as you begin to feel better . Being unkind to yourself will only make you feel worse - be kind to yourself and get some help .
Good luck .
I think a lot more people feel the same way as you do , but medicate themselves by using friends . Whilst it probably is n't a ' solution ' as such , being around friends whilst being depressed is definitely better than being alone and being depressed . Either way , if you fancy a chat , feel free to PM
If i were you id focus on an idol . Someone you aspire to ( not want to be them but someone who your admire and have respect for ) e.g. someone who came from a bad background and ended up successful and happy with a family and married etc etc
Focus on what you want to achieve in life , you havent stated what your studying , or indeed why .... is it because you wanted the experience ? Because your mum wanted yo to go ? Because u need a degree for the career you want to do ?
Either way , sum up why youre there and work your bottom off to get the best grades you can , cos once you get ur degree , you wil have something you can say " hey i didnt fail , it was hard work and i passed "

hope this helps
I 'm pretty much non - autistic ( not diagnosed with dyspraxia but I think the doctor misdiagnosed ) , but I walk on my toes nearly all of the time .
It 's more comfortable to me .
What made them decide toe - walking is a sign of autism since it seems so random and is n't always indicative ?
Well I might have signs of something on the autism spectrum but who does n't have one or two ?
You guys know what I mean .
Walking on toes can be a symptom of autism .
Having a headache can be a symptom of brain tumours .
Feeling tired a lot can be a symptom of leukaemia .
Symptoms do n't always apply but if they happen in a lot of cases ( which it clearly must do in this instance ) it 's worth noting , since otherwise nothing would ever get diagnosed .
I used to walk on my toes , but that was because I was born with strange toes that curled under and had to be straightened with surgery two years ago .
My brother 's autistic but I have n't noticed this with him either , but the spectrum is so broad and I myself probably have mild asperger 's because I have problems with communication and do n't pick up on social reactions / body language .
But then I do n't have a proper diagnosis and even having some symptoms might not mean you have a certain condition .
I walk on my toes not as much since years of being told not to .
I have dyspraxia .
So maybe you are dyspraxic or have short tendons .
People who do dance / gymnastics / ballet etc have it drilled into them , to the point where I find it more comfortable now = P
I would n't read too much into random " symptoms " like that
hello , i am a 12 year old girl ( 13 in two days ) who is addicted to self harming

i dont tell him but he finds out ,
i dont want to hurt him , i dont want him to hurt himself
what do i do
hanks you for reading
Are you on any drugs or getting any therapy ?
It might be an idea to talk to your school nurse or your GP and tell them what 's going on .
Perhaps there 's a teacher at school who you trust and could tell .
If you tell people they can help you ,
if you keep it bottled up inside it 's likely to only get worse .
Trust me , it 's better to get these things as early as possible rather than let them get even worse .
Please do n't do this ,
I 'm 17 I started self harming last year , mainly cutting my arms , but I have stopped since the last few months ,
its hard but you can do it .
I feel so much happier , but seeing the scars is both a painful reminder of how I felt at that time , how strong my feelings were that I would want to do such a thing to myself !
And , also strength , you can do it , I found salvation in poetry writing and keeping a journal ,
self harming is addictive , but you can overcome it ,
remember your self harming does not define who you are .
You can overcome it .
So I think Ive got a form of OCD because for the past year , I 've found that everytime I go out , especially to Uni , I 'm always checking my belongings to make sure I have n't lost or left anything .
I often have to check twice at one go , then after 30 seconds for some reason I cant resist checking again !
Why is this ! ?
Am I going crazy or something ?
It happens most often when I 'm carrying many things , but that is rarely and even still daily I 'm checking many times . And is this OCD to any extent ?
What can I do about this ?
If I do n't check , I get very very anxious , which does sort of go away after 15-30 mins , but often the anxiety is so much that I ca n't wait that long .
I feel if I lost my wallet or phone , then I 'm doomed or so I feel .
I just wish I could go out without worrying every 2 mins whether I 've left or lost something .
I really dont know what to do , and am afraid of going to the GP .
They 've probably never heard of some compulsion like this and I just dont know what to do
Do any of you have a similar ' ritual ' ?
People would think I 'm crazy , but it 's very strangely difficult to get yourself out of this .
What advice could you give me ?
I used to do this on my way to college - I had a list of items I knew I had on me and used to check compulsively on the bus .
I now have more severe anxiety and think this was just a warning sign so just try and wean yourself out of the habit while it 's relatively fresh - definitely visit your doctor but also tell yourself not to keep checking these things ( easier said than done I know ) .
Doctors will have seen much worse cases so do n't worry about that !
I did about OCD in psycology today : P
To get rid of it , one way could be just to avoid the compulsive act so do n't check to see whether you have lost something , just leave it ( :
Even though your anxiety levels would increase for a duration , they will gradualy decrease so hopefully , overtime your OCD will disappear ( :
To me that just sounds like you being overly anxious , as opposed to having really bad OCD .
I am very obsessional to the point where I get up 20 times a night to check the locks in my house are all locked a particular way .
Sometimes although I know they 're locked I 'm convinced they 're not .
I think it becomes a real problem when the obsession starts to really interrupt your everyday routine .
You definitely are n't crazy though do n't worry and your GP will be understanding of the issue I 'm sure .
I go to therapy ( for other reasons also ) and they have encouraged me to pick a number of times to check , obviously that is less than 20 , and to stick to it and cut down that way .
I think the idea is to teach me , I 'm still ' okay ' if I check 5 times or 20 times .
So far I have been a lot better , I think there is definitely hope of improvement for anyone that wants it .
Usually I 'm pretty calm about things and like to take things as they come and not to worry too much .
However , over the last month or two I 've found myself becoming really anxious about things , and I 'm not talking about a mere out of the blue feeling of nervousness .
I have begun to feel irrationally panicky about a variety of things which beforehand would n't worry me too much or even cross my mind as something to cause alarm bells to ring in my head .
I 'm not sure if it 's the change in lifestyle ( going from care - free student to unemployed graduate ) that is causing this or if it 's a sign of other issues , but it 's beginning to bug me as it 's affecting my confidence and happiness .
I 've spoken to a few people about it including my parents but they all think the same : that I 'm going through a random phase and that I should hold off taking action until it is clear that it is a serious problem
So was wondering what 's the best thing to do ?
Speak to a doctor about it and see if anti - anxiety pills could take the edge off of things ?
See if I can speak to a counsellor ?
Or should I take the advice given by the close people around me and just keep an eye on the anxiety until it becomes a problem ?
Well I woudnt try to keep an eye on ur anxiety for a start because that will make u tense and more likely to become more panicky ( circle of demise there )
what I would try to do is focus on something that is garunteed to make you smile or feel happier as soon as you start to feel a bit panicky about anything .
Or if u cant do that - when you start to feel panicky , get one of your friends to make you laugh ( it works for me and i suffer from random panic attacks lol
This started happening to me , where I 'd just start being really anxious over tiny things , although from the sound of things , not as severely as you .
What I find helps is just talking about what is making you anxious to someone else .
Perhaps not in a moany way but I found that mentioning the thing that I was worried about to my mum and seeing her react to the situation in a calm way ( like I should have been reacting ) made me feel better about it because I knew it was n't a big deal and I did n't need to be anxious about it .
However , if it gets worse , then yes , go to the doctor 's .
I have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety that can prevent her from leaving the house and doing things because she 's so worried about what can go wrong .
The doctors gave her medication and it 's made her much better .
