<ORGANIZATION>The International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> reached an agreement with Iranian officials that stated there were no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear program and activities .
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and European officials suspect that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's civilian nuclear energy program masks an effort to obtain technology that could be used in the production of an atomic bomb .
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and European officials suspect that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's civilian nuclear energy program masks an effort to obtain technology that could be used in the production of an atomic bomb .
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and European officials may impose a 4th round of sanctions on <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> when the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Security Council</ORGANIZATION> considers the issue of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear energy program most likely in <DATE>September 2007</DATE> .
The <ORGANIZATION>International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> distributed limited copies of the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> report before a meeting on 11 <DATE>September 2007</DATE> of the 35 members of the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> board .
The findings reflect an agency agreement on 21 <DATE>August 2007</DATE> with <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> that Iranian officials began publicizing the week of 12 <DATE>August 2007</DATE> .
The accord said that there were no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear program and activities .
According to an account by <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> news agency the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> report said the work plan is a significant step forward .
Reuters quoted a senior <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> official as stating the Iranian government 's efforts to enrich uranium had slowed .
The <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> report stated that Iranian officials must continue to build confidence about the scope and nature of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's present and future nuclear program .
Iranian officials on 30 <DATE>August 2007</DATE> stated cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> possibly to prevent a further round of international sanctions .
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's representative to the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH</ORGANIZATION> stated to <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Fars</ORGANIZATION> news agency that the report emphasized that there exists no sign or evidence indicating diversion of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear activities and that all of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear materials have been audited .
Some Nonproliferation Experts stated the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> was ceding too much to <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> .
Arms - control experts <PERSON>David Albright</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jacqueline Shire</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> - based <ORGANIZATION>Institute for Science and International Security</ORGANIZATION> wrote in a criticism published the <DATE>week of 19 August 2007</DATE> that the idea of closing files violates fundamental safeguards principles and that the agreement does not specify that Iranian officials would provide the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> access to key people , facilities , and documents that are needed to verify Iranian answers to the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> 's questions .
Independent experts stated <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's latest agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> which gives inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information falls short of the West 's demand to halt the production of concentrated uranium that could potentially be used for a bomb .
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman for the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration <PERSON>Tom Casey</PERSON> stated that while the report may offer some new details or insight into the development of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's program Iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program .
Casey stated the fact that the nuclear program continues to move forward shows that the Iranian regime is continuing on a path of defiance of the international community .
Most Western Nonproliferation Experts stated the Agreement on 21 <DATE>August 2007</DATE> contained little that could dissuade policymakers in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> from moving forward with another round of <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> sanctions .
Experts stated many of the transparency issues reportedly resolved in the Agreement on 21 <DATE>August 2007</DATE> should have been resolved previously .
Executive Director of nonpartisan <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> think tank the <ORGANIZATION>Arms Control Association</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Daryl G. Kimball</PERSON> stated the agreement does not address the problem that the Iranian government is pursuing an enrichment technology and capability that could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material .
<PERSON>Kimball</PERSON> stated the Iranian government 's design is to deflect criticism and pressure and to claim that progress is being made .
Iranian officials stated a possible reduction in collaboration with inspectors in the event of more sanctions .
The <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> has voted unanimously to impose sanctions against <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> but the penalties have been limited from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> demands under Chinese and Russian pressure .
SOLTANIEH stated in an interview with state - controlled Iranian television that the report and the measures taken make the intervention of any other international organization including the <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> irrelevant and unjustified .

proliferation ; technology ; international ; politics
Documents outlining the Israeli proposal to allow the international transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to nonproliferation rules were distributed to the <ORGANIZATION>Nuclear Suppliers Group</ORGANIZATION> .
The proposal may complicate the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration 's efforts to win an exemption for <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to engage in nuclear trade .
Israeli officials convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines allowing the international transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to nonproliferation rules .
Countries including <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> that have not signed the nuclear Non - <ORGANIZATION>Proliferation Treaty</ORGANIZATION> are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade which includes purchasing reactors , uranium fuel or yellowcake .
Documents outlining the Israeli proposal were distributed to the 45 - member <ORGANIZATION>Nuclear Suppliers Group</ORGANIZATION> ( NSG ) in <DATE>March 2007</DATE> .
The Israeli presentation was made in a nonpaper that allows for official deniability .
According to a letter from the Chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> on 17 <DATE>March 2007</DATE> the Israeli presentation was offered in the context of the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> 's debate over Indian officials ' bid for an exemption .
Among the nations that have not signed the Treaty only <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> would qualify for admission to the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> under the Israeli proposal .
The Israeli plan offered 12 criteria for allowing nuclear trade with non - treaty states .
1 criterion indicated <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> 's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and said a <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if <ORGANIZATION>the State</ORGANIZATION> applies stringent physical protection , control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons , nuclear facilities , source material and special nuclear material in the <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> 's territory .
The documents circulated on Capitol Hill in <DATE>September 2007</DATE> as the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration worked toward an agreement with Indian officials .
Executive Director of the <ORGANIZATION>Arms Control Association</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> <PERSON>Daryl Kimball</PERSON> stated the Israeli document could affect the debate over <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> .
<PERSON>Kimball</PERSON> stated --
The dynamics at the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> are that officials from the countries do not want to be obstacles to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> which is the largest country and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> which is the most powerful country .
Consensus on <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> will be difficult to reach when the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> meets in <DATE>November 2007</DATE> .
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> 's proposal gives officials from some countries reason to suggest an alternative approach to a specific exemption .
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> 's record is good and better than <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> 's in following international nuclear rules .
Despite ties between Israeli and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> governments the <ORGANIZATION>Bush Administration</ORGANIZATION> rejected the Israeli proposal .
The proposal may complicate the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration 's efforts to win an exemption for <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to engage in nuclear trade .
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON>Condoleezza Rice</PERSON> view the Pact as an important part of the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration 's foreign policy legacy .
The deal is controversial in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> must give approval .
Delays in winning approval for the <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> deal could have a negative effect on the administration 's foreign policy legacy with delay until an election year having the most negative effect .
<ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Tom Casey</PERSON> stated the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government views the <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> deal as unique and does not see the deal as a precedent for any other country including <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> .
Spokesman for the Israeli embassy <PERSON>David Siegel</PERSON> stated the suggestion that the Israeli government is demanding an exemption or linking efforts to any other issue including the <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> debate is grossly inaccurate .
Seigel stated --
The Israeli government has never asked the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> for any exemption to nuclear supply guidelines or made any Israeli - specific request of the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> .
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> is recognized as a full - fledged adherent to the <ORGANIZATION>NSG Guidelines</ORGANIZATION> .
The Israeli government has urged the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> to consider adopting a generic , multi - tiered , criteria - based approach towards nuclear technology transfers .
Some officials from <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> countries have previously suggested an approach like the Israeli plan .
If modification of the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> Guidelines were to take place along the lines proposed by Israeli officials the nuclear nonproliferation regime would be considerably enhanced .

<PERSON>Ahmadinejad</PERSON> announces expansion of Iranian uranium - producing capability .
Iran refuses commitment to halt expansion but hints a possible future halt .
20080726 Iranian President <PERSON>Mahmoud</PERSON> ahmadinejad stated to scholars in the northeastern city of mashbad that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> had expanded its arsenal of centrifuges producing enriched uranium to over 5000 .
The statement was ahmadinejad 's first asserting an expansion since the 20080400 announcement that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> was approaching the implementation of 6000 centrifuges .
Iran articulated the goal of 50000 centrifuges operating at the enrichment plant near the town of <LOCATION>Natanz</LOCATION> .
The international community has demanded that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> halt the production of nuclear material .
Media reports differed on the number of centrifuges ahmadinejad cited .
An Iranian news agency reported that ahmadinejad stated <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> had <DATE>6000</DATE> working centrifuges but the agency subsequently removed the statement from the Internet .
Another Iranian news agency stated that ahmadinejad referred to 100000s of centrifuges .
Experts discounted the significance of ahmadinejad 's claim in the absence of information on the centrifuges ' functionality .
A Western diplomat in <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> speaking under condition of anonymity stated that the quantity of centrifuges is less important than whether the machines are operational and efficient but that ahmadinejad 's assertion will hinder a resolution of the diplomatic standoff between <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> .
Arms control expert <PERSON>Jeffrey G. Lewis</PERSON> of the new <ORGANIZATION>America Foundation</ORGANIZATION> think tank stated that the Foundation was aware of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but the operational status of the machines is unknown .
Diplomats and arms control experts stated that the Iranian enrichment program is hindered by technical problems .
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear program aims to produce only electricity because nuclear weapon production contradicts Islamic principles .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the majority of Western arms control experts believe that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> is pursuing the capability to produce bombs immediately in the event of a decision .
Experts stated that producing weapons - grade uranium from reactor - grade material is relatively simple .
Ahmadinejad stated that after <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> resisted the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> 's demands for a halt in nuclear activities , the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> still pursued the resumption of negotiations .
<ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> foreign policy chief <PERSON>Javier Solana</PERSON> recently presented <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> with 2 offers --
A <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> - endorsed package of incentives to cease enriched uranium production
A 6 - week pre - negotiation ' freeze for freeze ' period during which <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> would add no centrifuges and the West would refrain from promoting a 4th round of economic sanctions against <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>UN Security Council</ORGANIZATION> .
US officials repeatedly stated that no negotiations can begin before <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> verifiably halts all enrichment - related activities but the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration recently agreed to the ' freeze for freeze ' proposal and dispatch burns to <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> .
20080726 during talks in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> attended by <ORGANIZATION>US Undersecretary of State</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>William J. Burns</PERSON> <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> refused to respond to <PERSON>Solana</PERSON> 's offers .
The talks constituted the highest - level diplomatic contact between the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> for nearly 30 years .
Solana , burns and European envoys set a deadline for <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> to respond positively before initiating new sanctions including prohibitions on selling <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> refined petroleum products vital to the country 's economy .
Iranian officials refused to commit to stopping expansion or to observe the deadline .
20080726 ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> might potentially halt expansion at a higher number of centrifuges that previously expected and for over 6 weeks .
Ahmadinejad stated that the West had consented to the existing 5000-6000 centrifuges in operation provided that the number did not increase .
5000 centrifuges can produce sufficient nuclear material for a power plant or an atomic bomb if the material is highly enriched .
6000 centrifuges running continuously can produce sufficient weapons - grade uranium for 1 bomb in 6 months .
20080500 the <ORGANIZATION>International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> stated that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> possessed 3500 centrifuges in operations .

A diplomatic meeting in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> concludes with no agreement on further steps to pressure <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> to halt uranium enrichment at <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's facility in <LOCATION>Natanz</LOCATION> .
On 081114 diplomats stated to the media that American , European , Russian and Chinese officials at a meeting on 081113 in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> did not reach agreement on further actions to persuade <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> to halt uranium enrichment at <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's facility in <LOCATION>Natanz</LOCATION> .
Uranium enrichment is a highly technical process that can produce fuel for a nuclear power plant or fissile material for atomic weapons .
The 081113 meeting ended without any new measures to announce .
After the 081113 meeting the French foreign ministry released a statement declaring the international community had reaffirmed the importance of the dual - track approach of engaging diplomatically with <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and working towards sanctions .
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> have resisted new sanctions against <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> .
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> have close political and business ties with <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and feel no domestic pressure to act against the Islamic Republic of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> .
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> does not have close political and business ties with <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and feels domestic pressure to act against the Islamic Republic of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> .
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> hold veto power over <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> decisions .
<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Interfax</ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted Russian diplomat <PERSON>Sergei ryabkov</PERSON> as stating that the parties struck no deal on sanctions against <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> at the 081113 meeting and that the Western countries are in favor of the sanctions against <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> while <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> did not support sanctions against <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> .
Sergei ryabkov attended the 081113 meeting .
A report released this week says <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> has made significant progress at <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's heavy - water research reactor facility near the city of <LOCATION>Arak</LOCATION> .
Iran 's heavy - water research reactor near <LOCATION>Arak</LOCATION> could eventually produce plutonium that might be used in a nuclear weapon .
Satellite images published by the <ORGANIZATION>Institute for Science and International Security</ORGANIZATION> show construction at the heavy - water research reactor facility near the city of <LOCATION>Arak</LOCATION> has progressed significantly between 080200 and 081000 .
<PERSON>David Albright</PERSON> stated that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's heavy - water research reactor near <LOCATION>Arak</LOCATION> has evaded the international security community 's notice .
<PERSON>David Albright</PERSON> stated that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's heavy - water research reactor near <LOCATION>Arak</LOCATION> is making significant progress according to the satellite images and that in a year and a half the heavy - water research reactor near <LOCATION>Arak</LOCATION> has progressed from building frames to a largely finished facility .
<PERSON>David Albright</PERSON> is a former arms inspector and Director of the <ORGANIZATION>Institute for Science and International Security</ORGANIZATION> that is based in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> .
Iran stated that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> is pursuing nuclear technology to produce energy and conduct research .
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and its western allies suspect that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's efforts to produce is a precursor to creating a nuclear - weapons infrastructure .
Low - grade uranium production is legal under international arms - control regulations .
The latest developments in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear technology development show the complex diplomatic and technical challenges facing the incoming foreign policy team of <LOCATION>United States President</LOCATION> - elect <PERSON>Barack Obama</PERSON> when it takes on the task of stopping <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> from mastering technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons .
The administration of <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> President <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON> in its last months in power has managed to synchronize <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> policies with the <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> , British , French and German leaders , to press for tougher sanctions and diplomatic action against <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> .
The <ORGANIZATION>International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> is expected to release a report critical of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> next week .
The <ORGANIZATION>International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> is the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> 's nuclear watchdog agency .
Due to the Act that no new initiatives regarding <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear program emerged from the 081113 <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> talks the hopes of imposing another set of <ORGANIZATION>United Nations Security Council</ORGANIZATION> sanctions before the end of President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's term were decreasing .
While diplomatic maneuvering is taking place <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> continues to work towards mastering nuclear and missile technology .

A high - security Russian laboratory complex storing anthrax , plague and other deadly bacteria faces loosing electricity for lack of payment to the <ORGANIZATION>mosenergo</ORGANIZATION> electric utility .
A large repository of anthrax , plague and other deadly bacteria stored in a high - security Russian laboratory complex 100 miles south of <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> is facing the threat of loosing electricity .
An official from the <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> region 's mosenergo electric utility arrived recently at the Russian laboratory complex and threatened to turn off the electricity for lack of payment .
The Russian laboratory complex is a 90 - building campus and served as the location for <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> 's secret biological weapons program in the Soviet era .
An incorrect headline in the newspaper Izvestia stated that deadly viruses from a <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> regional depository threaten <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> .
There are no viruses at the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>obolensk</LOCATION> .
At <ORGANIZATION>the State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology there is every kind of deadly bacteria that was studied for use in the secret biological weapons program of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> .
A large virus repository is located in <LOCATION>Siberia</LOCATION> .
Both Russian and Western officials have stated that it is unlikely that any public health threat would result from a power cutoff at the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology .
Russian and Western officials have stated that there is enough uncertainty that they could not be positive a loss of power at the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology would not cause a public health threat .
General <PERSON>Nikolai N. Urakov</PERSON> stated by telephone that the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology has quite reliable systems of protection in case of emergency .
General <PERSON>Nikolai N. Urakov</PERSON> is the longtime director of the <ORGANIZATION>the State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology .
The State scientific center of applied microbiology has been working with Western scientists to convert the complex into a biomedical manufacturing site .
General <PERSON>Nikolai N. Urakov</PERSON> stated by telephone that the people at the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology are scared by this threat of a sudden shutdown of electricity because it is a kind of psychological pressure on the people at the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology .
General <PERSON>Nikolai N. Urakov</PERSON> stated by telephone that in the event of a power shutdown at the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology scientists must destroy all bacteriological experiments under way .
General <PERSON>Nikolai N. Urakov</PERSON> would like the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and Western countries that have contributed about <MONEY>6 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> dollars to the transformation of the former bioweapons complex to contribute another 500000 <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> dollars per year to pay the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology 's electric bills and arrears .
An American scientist who works closely with the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology stated that the Russian government was responsible for paying for the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology 's electric bills .
Western aid for conversion of General <PERSON>Nikolai N. Urakov</PERSON> 's one time bioweapons laboratory peaked in 970000 because it was learned that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> had made offers to the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology to purchase its expertise .
Russian scientists and military leaders who now depend on Western financing to destroy nuclear , chemical and biological weapons have been known to orchestrate a sense of crisis to increase financing .
American scientist <PERSON>Randall Lee Beatty</PERSON> is working on the conversion of the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>obolensk</LOCATION> .
Beatty stated that this threat to cut electricity to the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology is a crisis .
<PERSON>Randall Lee Beatty</PERSON> is a Director of the <ORGANIZATION>International Science and Technology Center</ORGANIZATION> .
The <ORGANIZATION>International Science and Technology Center</ORGANIZATION> finances approximately half of General <PERSON>Nikolai N. Urakov</PERSON> 's budget to support about 350 Russian biowarfare scientists and technicians .
<PERSON>Randall Lee Beatty</PERSON> stated that it is known that the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology has not paid its electricity bill for 14 months .
<PERSON>Randall Lee Beatty</PERSON> stated that the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology is one of the important archives for dangerous pathogens in the world and it would be a shame if those archives were destroyed for not paying the electricity utility .
Approximately 3000 strains of bacteria are stored at the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology and many of the bacteria are stored in cryogenic casks cooled with liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment by layered enclosures and oversize air - handling systems that all depend on electricity to function .
The greatest danger from a shutdown of electric power at the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology would be the defrosting of live germs that are currently preserved in a frozen state .
A biological warfare expert at the <ORGANIZATION>Monterey Institute of International Studies</ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON>Raymond zilinskas</PERSON> stated that the main threat from cutting power to the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology would be to the organisms themselves rather than that they might escape .
<PERSON>Raymond zilinskas</PERSON> stated that in the worst case the bacteria would be defrosted from minus 70 degrees and it would be a real mess to clean up afterward because it would not be known for certain whether all the bacteria was dead .
The confrontation between the <ORGANIZATION>mosenergo</ORGANIZATION> electric utility and the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied Microbiology in <LOCATION>obolensk</LOCATION> is another example of how the basic capitalist imperative for enterprises to be self - sustaining can clash in a dangerous way with the old remnants of Soviet weapons science .
Due to an overdue power bill in 000000 the <ORGANIZATION>Russian National Power Company</ORGANIZATION> cut off electricity to a strategic base where nuclear missiles stood on high alert .
The nuclear missile silos themselves did not lose power .
Armed troops marched to the substations and turned the power back on .
In 010100 and 010200 the national utility , <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> energy systems cut power to a number of military installations around <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> .
The military installations that lost power included the Russian space forces monitoring center on the <LOCATION>Kamchatka Peninsula</LOCATION> .
In most cases of military installations having their electricity cut off the electricity has been quickly restored .
Often investigations show that the tug of war with the utility forces the military to spend budgeted funds for electrical power instead of diverting money for other uses .
Some of the budgeted funds cut at times have included the building country residences for generals .

<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> to implement law allowing air force to target drug trafficking aircraft in Brazilian airspace .
US concerned over liability in the event of misidentification of a civilian plane .
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> announced that the air force will begin shooting down aircraft used in trafficking illegal drugs in Brazilian airspace .
The plan requires 8 precautionary steps before the order to shoot down a plane may be issued .
Prior to the policy taking effect late 20041000 a publicity campaign will notify ranchers and others of the need to file flight plans .
The Law to permit such an action was originally approved in <DATE>1998</DATE> but <DATE>1995-2003</DATE> President <PERSON>Fernando Henrique Cardoso</PERSON> never put the policy into effect .
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> dissuaded Cardoso from signing the decree out of concern that the accidental downing of civilian aircraft could expose the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government and companies to lawsuits .
20010400 the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> reduced previous support for operations targeting drug - running aircraft when a Peruvian jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed an American missionary and her child .
Relatives of the victims sued the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government and won a settlement due to the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> 's provision of intelligence and technical support to the operation .
A <ORGANIZATION>US State Department</ORGANIZATION> official stated --
US law may forbid assistance to countries that implement shoot - down laws under certain conditions .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> agrees with the Brazilian assessment that the threat posed by drug traffickers is both very serious and increasing .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government has consulted the Brazilian Government about the provisions of US law .
Brazilian Defense Minister <PERSON>Jose Viegas</PERSON> stated that <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> has encountered difficulties in securing US support for the plan but recent bilateral talks led to certainty that the decree would be accepted by the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government without exposing <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> to commercial sanctions .
Brazilian officials have expressed hope that the policy will be endorsed by the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> before going into effect .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> is scheduled to provide <MONEY>10.2 million dollars</MONEY> in drug and law enforcement aid to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> in <DATE>2004</DATE> .
Former air force chief and current Director of the <ORGANIZATION>Air Institute at estacio de sa University in Rio de Janeiro General Mauro Jose Miranda gandra</ORGANIZATION> stated that the measure was a courageous step by the Government but the impact may be more political than practical because of self - imposed restrictions by the Brazilian government .
Brazilian officials stated that the policy would be inapplicable against aircraft with children on board .
Viegas stated that the limitation was necessary .
Gandra stated that the provision undermines the decree 's essential purpose by granting immunity to drug - smuggling aircraft carrying children and thus introducing the possibility of kidnapped children being used as human shields .
Viegas stated in an interview in <LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION> that the government will use the law to more powerfully dissuade drug traffickers who have previously entered Brazilian airspace feeling unthreatened by the air force .
The Government was prompted to act due to the deteriorating public security situation with increasingly powerful and violent drug gangs in <LOCATION>Sao Paolo</LOCATION> and particularly <ORGANIZATION>Rio de Janeiro</ORGANIZATION> .
Rio de Janeiro drug gangs have more firepower than the police and have successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close .
President <PERSON>Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva</PERSON> stated in a <DATE>2003</DATE> interview with foreign correspondents --
The policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security .
Some pilots of drug - running aircraft felt so confidently immune from retribution as to make obscene gestures at pursuing Brazilian air force pilots .
The constitutionality of the law has been questioned under <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> 's prohibition of the death penalty as punishment for criminal acts .
Some legal experts and other commentators stated that contrary to government claims , the Statute amounts to a de facto execution of drug traffickers .
The daily newspaper O Estado de <LOCATION>Sao Paolo</LOCATION> stated in an editorial the week of 20040718-20040824 -- the extreme measure raises ethical and juridical problems exceeding any potential benefits .
The penalty will be applied extrajudicially by administrative decision of the Commander of the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> .
This person will gain life and death power over crew members and passengers of irregular flights .
In <DATE>2002</DATE> Brazil inaugurated the 1.4 billion dollar <ORGANIZATION>SIVAM</ORGANIZATION> radar system allowing the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansive <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> region for the first time .
The system uses American technology .
Illegal Flights initially declined <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> due to trafficker 's concerns about improved tracking capabilities but subsequently reaccelerated .
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> recorded <DATE>4128</DATE> unauthorized flights in <DATE>2003</DATE> .
Some of these flights were innocent violations by ranchers in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> flying between plantations .
Viegas stated that there was a significant increase in deliberate violations of Brazilian airspace , apparently by drug smugglers realizing that the government was incapable of retaliation .
20010400 <ORGANIZATION>Rio de Janeiro</ORGANIZATION> 's most notorious drug boss , <LOCATION>Fernandinho Beira</LOCATION> - <DATE>Mar</DATE> , was captured in <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> in a guns - for drugs pipeline involving left - wing guerrillas .

The Venezuelan president 's weapons deals with <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , curbs on military cooperation with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , and his plans to train as many as <MONEY>2 million</MONEY> Venezuelan civilians to repel a possible invasion by superpowers have the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and his domestic critics worried .
Venezuelan president <PERSON>Hugo Chavez</PERSON> 's weapons deals with <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , curbs on military cooperation with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , and plans to train as many as <MONEY>2 million</MONEY> Venezuelan civilians to repel a possible invasion by imperialist superpowers have the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> 's domestic critics worried about what the leftist former military officer is planning .
Chavez insists that the moves are purely defensive and born of an overdue need to update obsolete military hardware and protect <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> from nations that might want to take control of <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> .
<LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> is <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> 's largest petroleum - producing state .
Chavez 's domestic opponents scoff at the idea that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> would ever invade <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> and charge that <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> 's true intention is to arm a huge cadre of loyal reservists who would protect <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> against any internal uprising and to pose as a militarized counterweight to <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> influence in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> .
Cuban leader <PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON> is <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> 's his major ally and <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> is growing closer to <PERSON>Castro</PERSON> .
Chavez 's detractors in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government say that it is even more troubling that <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> 's arms purchases and indoctrination of civilian militias could be part of a strategy to restructure Venezuelan democracy in the image of Cuban - style militarized socialism and foment leftist revolutions throughout <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> .
US military strategists say they are increasingly concerned that radical movements inspired by <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> could foment such revolution .
The political mainstream in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> has shifted leftward since the <DATE>late 1990s</DATE> .
This leftward shift is largely in reaction to the perceived failure of free - market economics .
Leftists have been elected to lead <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> .
Chavez 's supporters at home counter that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has a century - long history of open as well as covert armed intervention in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> 's domestic politics and say that it has no right to question <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> 's defense preparations .
Carlos <PERSON>Roque Espinoza Leon</PERSON> said that Venezuelans never ask what the <ORGANIZATION>US Marines</ORGANIZATION> are doing .
<PERSON>Espinoza Leon</PERSON> is a pro - <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> defense specialist who serves in <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION> .
<PERSON>Espinoza</PERSON> said that <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> has 500000 rifles and no one says anything .
<PERSON>Espinoza</PERSON> said no one complains that <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> is the most militarized country in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> .
<PERSON>Espinoza</PERSON> said <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> history is full of aggression in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> .
<PERSON>Espinoza</PERSON> said Venezuelans have to do whatever is necessary to protect <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> .
Chavez has famously said that the Venezuelan so - called Bolivarian revolution is peaceful but not unarmed .
Chavez was first elected in 980000 and has a popularity rating of <PERCENT>71 percent</PERCENT> in an independent poll by polling firm <ORGANIZATION>Datanalisis</ORGANIZATION> .
Venezuelan military analyst <PERSON>Alberto Garrido</PERSON> said <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> is looking for allies in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> in order to promote a multi - polar world which will counteract US dominance and encourage grassroots Movements in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> to throw off <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> governmental influence .
<PERSON>Lorenzo Campos</PERSON> is a farmer in <LOCATION>Anzoategui</LOCATION> state in northern <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> and is training as a reservist .
<PERSON>Campos</PERSON> said Venezuelans want the world to know that Venezuelans are not preparing to attack anyone and that the mission is to protect <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> .
In <DATE>May</DATE> , <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> 's government announced details in 050500 of an <MONEY>$ 18.6 million</MONEY> deal with a Russian firm to purchase 100000 AK - 103 assault rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition each and the technology transfer for <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> to manufacture the rifles .
The deal works out to <MONEY>$ 186.22</MONEY> per rifle .
This price is considerably less costly than the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> mail - order price of <MONEY>$ 825</MONEY> to <MONEY>$ 850</MONEY> for the same weapon .
The Government of <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> also intends to buy 10 Russian helicopters , 10 Spanish transport planes , and 6 Spanish naval craft .
Venezuelan officials say the government is negotiating with <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> to buy around 24 air support and training planes .
Chavez has insisted and even his staunchest retired military Critics here agree that the purchases are essential to update old weaponry such as the military 's decades - old Belgian FAL rifles .
Retired General <PERSON>Fernando OCHOA ANTICH</PERSON> said that it is an exaggeration to say <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> is engaged in an arms buildup .
Ochoa was defense minister in 920000 when then - Lieutenant Colonel Chavez launched a failed coup .
Ochoa stated that <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> has n't purchased arms in 25 years and said and <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> is not aggressively buying weapons in a way that would threaten his neighbors .
<PERSON>Ochoa</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> has never bought Russian arms before and suggested <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> is doing it to become independent from the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> .
Ochoa asked why <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> is buying a caliber of rifle which is popular among subversive forces in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> and stated that the political support <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> gives to radical leftist movements makes <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> a continental menace .
The <ORGANIZATION>US Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> has openly questioned what <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> will do with the old <ORGANIZATION>FAL</ORGANIZATION> rifles and whether <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> might share weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government has provided no evidence of Chavez arming or funding leftist insurgencies .
Military analysts and specialists on the <ORGANIZATION>Colombian FARC</ORGANIZATION> guerrillas say the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and would not be interested in old Belgian rifles or in assistance from <LOCATION>Chavez</LOCATION> .
A 030000 study published by the <ORGANIZATION>US Defense Intelligence Agency</ORGANIZATION> reported that more than half of the weapons seized from Colombian guerrillas from 980000 to 010000 that had markings of foreign militaries were of Venezuelan origin .
The implication was that corrupt or sympathetic members of the Venezuelan military may be aiding guerrillas .
Perhaps more distressing to <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> 's domestic opponents is the ideological training that critics say <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> has in mind for the military and for new civilian reservists .
Chavez called earlier in 050000 for so - called Revolutionary units to start preparing the public to resist a superpower aggressor and said the first step would be to train from 100000 to 2 million volunteers in the coming years to back up active - duty armed forces .
Military analysts estimate <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> 's active - duty armed forces number 83,000 .
People 's defense units would be created in neighborhoods , <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> companies , and the <ORGANIZATION>Free University</ORGANIZATION> established under <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> and would report directly to the president .
The government insists the reserves will support the armed forces and not act as a fifth column against a possible anti - <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> coup .
<PERSON>Espinoza</PERSON> said the reserves are not to be used as shock troops for any political party and that if there were a civil war , it would be up to each person to take their own side .
General <PERSON>Julio Ramon Quintero viloria</PERSON> is commander of the reserves .
<PERSON>Quintero</PERSON> said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50000 civilians over 20 weekends in <DATE>the second half of 050000</DATE> and could train 300000 more in 060000 .
<PERSON>Quintero</PERSON> said that Venezuelans do n't want to be the colony of any empire and have to be ready for any possibility .
100000 reservists in 050600 engaged with the <ORGANIZATION>Venezuelan navy</ORGANIZATION> in a massive war game to repel a stronger country that had invaded .
40 employees of the state oil company participated in a similar exercise with 1200 soldiers in 050600 .
Pro - <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> circles here warn of asymmetrical warfare .
Asymmetrical warfare is a term coined by <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> military strategists to describe a conflict between unequal combatants where the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government has given <MONEY>$ 3.3 billion</MONEY> in mostly military aid to <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> in the past 5 years .
Chavez loyalists fear that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government could instigate a proxy war between <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> as a way to oust <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> and control Venezuelan oil .
A senior <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> official in an interview dismissed the notion that the <ORGANIZATION>United States Government</ORGANIZATION> wants to invade <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> as complete and utter nonsense .
The official said the chavista side wishes to make the relationship negative because they 've made a political calculation that Mr. <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> reached power by constantly being in confrontation with the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> .
Another development that has troubled the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> 's rollback of military cooperation and joint exercises .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> military had a <ORGANIZATION>Cooperation Office</ORGANIZATION> for 50 years in a <LOCATION>Venezuelan Fort</LOCATION> .
Chavez shut it down in 040000 .
5 <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> military trainers and students participating in an exchange program were ordered to leave the country in 050400 .
Analysts say that it is likely <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> is trying to indoctrinate his public and armed forces .
Analysts say that there is no proof that <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> will use those forces to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere .

Hill stated <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> inspectors will hold talks with <LOCATION>Pyongyang</LOCATION> officials on sealing the reactor which would include the installation of television monitors at the site .
North Korean officials refused to proceed with a <DATE>February 2007</DATE> agreement to begin decommissioning the <LOCATION>Yongbyon</LOCATION> reactor until funds worth <MONEY>25 million dollars</MONEY> in accounts linked to <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> held in a <LOCATION>Macao Bank</LOCATION> were transferred to <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> .
The money was frozen when officials from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> accused the <LOCATION>Banco Delta Asia</LOCATION> of complicity in financial crimes on behalf of <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> .
The funds were wired on 14 <DATE>June 2007</DATE> to the <ORGANIZATION>New York Federal Reserve Bank</ORGANIZATION> after months of disagreement over the method of returning the funds .
The funds were to be sent to <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> before a transfer to an account controlled by the <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> government in a Russian commercial bank .
Hill stated talks will occur the week of 17 <DATE>June 2007</DATE> with disarmament negotiators from <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> on steps to recoup some of the time lost while the financial transfer was being organized .
The discussions will also involve setting a timetable for resumption of 6 - nation arms control talks .
Under the agreement reached in <DATE>February 2007</DATE> North Korean officials pledged to shut down the <LOCATION>Yongbyon</LOCATION> reactor and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for a 50000 - ton shipment of fuel oil .
North Korean officials will declare all nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for a further 950000 tons of fuel oil in the next phase of the Agreement .
Hill stated the technical possibility of concluding the next phase of the agreement by <DATE>December 2007</DATE> .

A list from the <ORGANIZATION>Nuclear Suppliers Group</ORGANIZATION> shows that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> has been denied purchases of nuclear - related materials approximately 75 times since <DATE>1998</DATE> because of suspicions the purchases could have been used for building bombs .
The 45 - nation <ORGANIZATION>Nuclear Suppliers Group</ORGANIZATION> is an offshoot of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and is charged with monitoring international trade to ensure that nuclear technology transferred for peaceful purposes is not directed to military use .
The <ORGANIZATION>Nuclear Suppliers Group</ORGANIZATION> is composed of technologically advanced countries .
According to the <ORGANIZATION>Nuclear Suppliers Group</ORGANIZATION> 's mission statement countries act on an individual basis to block trades that violate export controls devised to maintain international cooperation on peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
The <ORGANIZATION>Nuclear Suppliers Group</ORGANIZATION> has no enforcement power beyond notifying companies of violating the group 's guidelines .
The <ORGANIZATION>Nuclear Suppliers Group</ORGANIZATION> keeps data private and meets largely in secret .
Most of the denials of purchase have occurred since <DATE>2002</DATE> and have resulted from interventions by members of the <ORGANIZATION>Nuclear Suppliers Group</ORGANIZATION> .
The list of trade denials was made available by a diplomat from a country interested in exposing the extent of Iranian efforts to acquire so - called dual - use items that can be converted to weapons production .
The list was made available on condition that neither the diplomat nor the diplomat 's country be identified .
The list names companies from <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>United Arab Emirates</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> that were prevented from carrying out deals because the items being sold were suspected of being militarily useful .

The official website of <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> 's Shiite leader the Grand <PERSON>Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani</PERSON> was among the websites defaced and blocked .
Group XP stated on the defaced website that any website that contained material contrary to Sunni teachings would be hacked .
The official website of <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> 's Shiite religious leader the Grand <PERSON>Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani</PERSON> was defaced and blocked in a sectarian - motivated cyber attack on Shiite - related sites .
It was not clear whether the attack began on 18 <DATE>September 2008</DATE> or the morning of 19 <DATE>September 2008</DATE> .
By the evening of 19 <DATE>September 2008</DATE> Al-Sistani 's website was offline .
Another website related to 1 of <PERSON>Al-Sistani</PERSON> 's religious organizations , www.al-shia.com , was also affected .
An alternative address , www.sistani.com , was still operational .
<ORGANIZATION>Iranian News Agency Fars</ORGANIZATION> stated that group XP had blocked access to approximately 300 Shiite - related sites on 18 <DATE>September 2008</DATE> and <DATE>19 September 2008</DATE> .
Neither the hacking claim nor an Iranian assertion that group XP was based in the <ORGANIZATION>United Arab Emirates</ORGANIZATION> could be verified independently .

Somali pirates who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms are approaching a deal for the ship 's release .
Questions have emerged regarding the shipment of arms en route to <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> and of a possible clandestine arms deal between <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Sudan</LOCATION> .
On 08 <DATE>October 2008</DATE> Maritime officials and associates of the Somali pirates who on 25 <DATE>September 2008</DATE> hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms stated that the pirates may soon be collecting their ransom .
After difficult negotiations likened by several people involved to bazaar - style haggling the parties are close to reaching a deal in which the pirates would be paid <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> and the ship freed .
A businessman in <LOCATION>xarardheere</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> named Ahmed Omar stated that the pirates and the ship owners have agreed on a ransom of approximately <MONEY>8 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollars and the ship may be freed on 08 <DATE>October 2008</DATE> or 09 <DATE>October 2008</DATE> .
Xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on the coast of <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> .
Maritime officials in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> stated that critical details have yet to be agreed upon .
One such detail involves the pirates ' request for a guarantee that they would not be arrested or attacked by the armada of American warships currently encircling them .
A Kenyan maritime official stated anonymously that such negotiations are complex and involve more than the financial aspect .
On 08 <DATE>October 2008</DATE> the official stated that progress is being made and the parties are approaching an agreement .
The pirates initially requested 35 million <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollars and then reduced their request to <MONEY>20 million U.S. dollars</MONEY> .
The pirates have consistently expressed willingness to negotiate the financial figures .
More than 25 ships have been hijacked in <DATE>2008</DATE> off the <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> coast with a typical ransom of between 1 and <MONEY>2 million U.S. dollars</MONEY> .
The pirates aboard the Ukrainian ship have stated that upon receipt of payment in American dollars and preferably in 100 dollar bills the ship , its cargo and the 20 sailors on board will be released .
The original country of destination for the arms shipment aboard the Ukrainian ship is being questioned .
Shortly after the freighter was hijacked on 25 <DATE>September 2008</DATE> the Kenyan government claimed that the weapons on board were being shipped for <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> 's military .
The ship was en route to <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> 's main port of <LOCATION>Mombasa</LOCATION> .
The weapons on board the ship included 33 T - 72 tanks , 150 grenade launchers , 6 anti - aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition .
Evidence has subsequently emerged that the weapons were part of a clandestine arms deal between <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> and the separatist region of southern <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> .
The deal would most likely have remained secret had the pirates not hijacked the ship and begun speaking to the media by satellite phone .
Ukrainian officials have been adamant in denying any wrongdoing .
Ukrainian diplomat in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> oleh belokolos stated --
<LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> does not supply or have plans to supply any armaments to the Government of <LOCATION>South Sudan</LOCATION> .
All the appropriate paperwork has been validated .
<LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> abides by all <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> rules and arms control agreements .

Head of the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> drug office <ORGANIZATION>Antonio Maria Costa</ORGANIZATION> said that <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency .
Head of the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> drug office <ORGANIZATION>Antonio Maria Costa</ORGANIZATION> said that <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency .
Costa said this to reporters last week as the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Drug Office Office</ORGANIZATION> prepared to release its latest survey of <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> 's opium crop .
The survey showed that poppy cultivation had retreated in much of <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> and was overwhelmingly concentrated in 7 of 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strong , most of those in the south .
The survey was issued <DATE>November 27 , 2008</DATE> .
The <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> found that the result was a <PERCENT>19 percent</PERCENT> reduction in the amount of land devoted to opium in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> even though the total tonnage of opium produced dropped by just <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> .
The study stated that the high output per acre was attributed to a good growing season in the south .
The southern region is a heavily irrigated area where the Taliban maintained a strong presence in 5 provinces and have systematically encouraged opium cultivation as a way to finance their insurgency for several years .
The <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> estimates the insurgents made as much as <MONEY>300 million dollars</MONEY> from the opium trade last year .
Costa said a lot of war effort can be funded with 2 to <MONEY>300 million dollars</MONEY> .
The Taliban have producing an amount of opium that far exceeds world demand due to 3 successive years of bumper crops .
Costa said the result was a glut that was depressing the price , which dropped by approximately <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> .
Costa said that the fact that prices had not collapsed already was evidence that the Taliban , drug lords and even some farmers have stockpiled the opium .
An increasing amount is also being processed in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> .
Costa added that insurgents have been holding significant amounts of opium .
Costa said the surplus is as much as 11000 tons , or more than twice world demand in the <DATE>last 3 years</DATE> and threatened to devalue their stockpiles .
The <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> found that <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> produced <DATE>8500</DATE> tons of opium in <DATE>2008</DATE> .
World demand was estimated at about <DATE>4400</DATE> tons per year .
The Taliban this year are taking a passive stance toward cultivation and putting less pressure on Afghan farmers to plant opium poppy .
This then supports the current price .
Costa is an Italian diplomat who has served at the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Office on Drugs</ORGANIZATION> and Crime for 6 years .
