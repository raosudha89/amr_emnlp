The International Atomic Energy Agency reached an agreement with Iranian officials that stated there were no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding Iran 's nuclear program and activities .
U.S. and European officials suspect that Iran 's civilian nuclear energy program masks an effort to obtain technology that could be used in the production of an atomic bomb .
U.S. and European officials suspect that Iran 's civilian nuclear energy program masks an effort to obtain technology that could be used in the production of an atomic bomb .
U.S. and European officials may impose a 4th round of sanctions on Tehran when the U.N. Security Council considers the issue of Iran 's nuclear energy program most likely in September 2007 .
The International Atomic Energy Agency distributed limited copies of the IAEA report before a meeting on 11 September 2007 of the 35 members of the IAEA board .
The findings reflect an agency agreement on 21 August 2007 with Tehran that Iranian officials began publicizing the week of 12 August 2007 .
The accord said that there were no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding Iran 's nuclear program and activities .
According to an account by Reuters news agency the IAEA report said the work plan is a significant step forward .
Reuters quoted a senior U.N. official as stating the Iranian government 's efforts to enrich uranium had slowed .
The IAEA report stated that Iranian officials must continue to build confidence about the scope and nature of Iran 's present and future nuclear program .
Iranian officials on 30 August 2007 stated cooperation with the IAEA possibly to prevent a further round of international sanctions .
Iran 's representative to the IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated to Tehran 's Fars news agency that the report emphasized that there exists no sign or evidence indicating diversion of Iran 's nuclear activities and that all of Iran 's nuclear materials have been audited .
Some Nonproliferation Experts stated the IAEA was ceding too much to Iran .
Arms - control experts David Albright and Jacqueline Shire of the Washington - based Institute for Science and International Security wrote in a criticism published the week of 19 August 2007 that the idea of closing files violates fundamental safeguards principles and that the agreement does not specify that Iranian officials would provide the IAEA access to key people , facilities , and documents that are needed to verify Iranian answers to the IAEA 's questions .
Independent experts stated Iran 's latest agreement with the IAEA which gives inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information falls short of the West 's demand to halt the production of concentrated uranium that could potentially be used for a bomb .
U.S. State Department spokesman for the Bush administration Tom Casey stated that while the report may offer some new details or insight into the development of Iran 's program Iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program .
Casey stated the fact that the nuclear program continues to move forward shows that the Iranian regime is continuing on a path of defiance of the international community .
Most Western Nonproliferation Experts stated the Agreement on 21 August 2007 contained little that could dissuade policymakers in Washington , London , Paris and Berlin from moving forward with another round of Security Council sanctions .
Experts stated many of the transparency issues reportedly resolved in the Agreement on 21 August 2007 should have been resolved previously .
Executive Director of nonpartisan Washington think tank the Arms Control Association Daryl G. Kimball stated the agreement does not address the problem that the Iranian government is pursuing an enrichment technology and capability that could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material .
Kimball stated the Iranian government 's design is to deflect criticism and pressure and to claim that progress is being made .
Iranian officials stated a possible reduction in collaboration with inspectors in the event of more sanctions .
The Security Council has voted unanimously to impose sanctions against Iran but the penalties have been limited from U.S. demands under Chinese and Russian pressure .
SOLTANIEH stated in an interview with state - controlled Iranian television that the report and the measures taken make the intervention of any other international organization including the Security Council irrelevant and unjustified .

Documents outlining the Israeli proposal to allow the international transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to nonproliferation rules were distributed to the Nuclear Suppliers Group .
The proposal may complicate the Bush administration 's efforts to win an exemption for India to engage in nuclear trade .
Israeli officials convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines allowing the international transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to nonproliferation rules .
Countries including India , Israel and Pakistan that have not signed the nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade which includes purchasing reactors , uranium fuel or yellowcake .
Documents outlining the Israeli proposal were distributed to the 45 - member Nuclear Suppliers Group ( NSG ) in March 2007 .
The Israeli presentation was made in a nonpaper that allows for official deniability .
According to a letter from the Chairman of the NSG on 17 March 2007 the Israeli presentation was offered in the context of the NSG 's debate over Indian officials ' bid for an exemption .
Among the nations that have not signed the Treaty only India and Israel would qualify for admission to the NSG under the Israeli proposal .
The Israeli plan offered 12 criteria for allowing nuclear trade with non - treaty states .
1 criterion indicated Israel 's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and said a State should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if the State applies stringent physical protection , control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons , nuclear facilities , source material and special nuclear material in the State 's territory .
The documents circulated on Capitol Hill in September 2007 as the Bush administration worked toward an agreement with Indian officials .
Executive Director of the Arms Control Association in Washington Daryl Kimball stated the Israeli document could affect the debate over India .
Kimball stated --
The dynamics at the NSG are that officials from the countries do not want to be obstacles to India which is the largest country and the United States which is the most powerful country .
Consensus on India will be difficult to reach when the NSG meets in November 2007 .
Israel 's proposal gives officials from some countries reason to suggest an alternative approach to a specific exemption .
Israel 's record is good and better than India 's in following international nuclear rules .
Despite ties between Israeli and U.S. governments the Bush Administration rejected the Israeli proposal .
The proposal may complicate the Bush administration 's efforts to win an exemption for India to engage in nuclear trade .
President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice view the Pact as an important part of the Bush administration 's foreign policy legacy .
The deal is controversial in India and Congress must give approval .
Delays in winning approval for the India deal could have a negative effect on the administration 's foreign policy legacy with delay until an election year having the most negative effect .
State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated the U.S. government views the India deal as unique and does not see the deal as a precedent for any other country including Israel .
Spokesman for the Israeli embassy David Siegel stated the suggestion that the Israeli government is demanding an exemption or linking efforts to any other issue including the India debate is grossly inaccurate .
Seigel stated --
The Israeli government has never asked the NSG for any exemption to nuclear supply guidelines or made any Israeli - specific request of the NSG .
Israel is recognized as a full - fledged adherent to the NSG Guidelines .
The Israeli government has urged the NSG to consider adopting a generic , multi - tiered , criteria - based approach towards nuclear technology transfers .
Some officials from NSG countries have previously suggested an approach like the Israeli plan .
If modification of the NSG Guidelines were to take place along the lines proposed by Israeli officials the nuclear nonproliferation regime would be considerably enhanced .

Ahmadinejad announces expansion of Iranian uranium - producing capability .
Iran refuses commitment to halt expansion but hints a possible future halt .
20080726 Iranian President Mahmoud ahmadinejad stated to scholars in the northeastern city of mashbad that Iran had expanded its arsenal of centrifuges producing enriched uranium to over 5000 .
The statement was ahmadinejad 's first asserting an expansion since the 20080400 announcement that Iran was approaching the implementation of 6000 centrifuges .
Iran articulated the goal of 50000 centrifuges operating at the enrichment plant near the town of Natanz .
The international community has demanded that Iran halt the production of nuclear material .
Media reports differed on the number of centrifuges ahmadinejad cited .
An Iranian news agency reported that ahmadinejad stated Iran had 6000 working centrifuges but the agency subsequently removed the statement from the Internet .
Another Iranian news agency stated that ahmadinejad referred to 100000s of centrifuges .
Experts discounted the significance of ahmadinejad 's claim in the absence of information on the centrifuges ' functionality .
A Western diplomat in Tehran speaking under condition of anonymity stated that the quantity of centrifuges is less important than whether the machines are operational and efficient but that ahmadinejad 's assertion will hinder a resolution of the diplomatic standoff between Iran and the West .
Arms control expert Jeffrey G. Lewis of the new America Foundation think tank stated that the Foundation was aware of Iran 's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but the operational status of the machines is unknown .
Diplomats and arms control experts stated that the Iranian enrichment program is hindered by technical problems .
Iran has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear program aims to produce only electricity because nuclear weapon production contradicts Islamic principles .
The US , Israel , Europe and the majority of Western arms control experts believe that Iran is pursuing the capability to produce bombs immediately in the event of a decision .
Experts stated that producing weapons - grade uranium from reactor - grade material is relatively simple .
Ahmadinejad stated that after Iran resisted the West 's demands for a halt in nuclear activities , the West still pursued the resumption of negotiations .
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana recently presented Iran with 2 offers --
A US - endorsed package of incentives to cease enriched uranium production
A 6 - week pre - negotiation ' freeze for freeze ' period during which Iran would add no centrifuges and the West would refrain from promoting a 4th round of economic sanctions against Iran at the UN Security Council .
US officials repeatedly stated that no negotiations can begin before Iran verifiably halts all enrichment - related activities but the Bush administration recently agreed to the ' freeze for freeze ' proposal and dispatch burns to Geneva .
20080726 during talks in Geneva attended by US Undersecretary of State William J. Burns Iran refused to respond to Solana 's offers .
The talks constituted the highest - level diplomatic contact between the US and Iran for nearly 30 years .
Solana , burns and European envoys set a deadline for Iran to respond positively before initiating new sanctions including prohibitions on selling Iran refined petroleum products vital to the country 's economy .
Iranian officials refused to commit to stopping expansion or to observe the deadline .
20080726 ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that Iran might potentially halt expansion at a higher number of centrifuges that previously expected and for over 6 weeks .
Ahmadinejad stated that the West had consented to the existing 5000-6000 centrifuges in operation provided that the number did not increase .
5000 centrifuges can produce sufficient nuclear material for a power plant or an atomic bomb if the material is highly enriched .
6000 centrifuges running continuously can produce sufficient weapons - grade uranium for 1 bomb in 6 months .
20080500 the International Atomic Energy Agency stated that Iran possessed 3500 centrifuges in operations .

A diplomatic meeting in Paris concludes with no agreement on further steps to pressure Iran to halt uranium enrichment at Iran 's facility in Natanz .
On 081114 diplomats stated to the media that American , European , Russian and Chinese officials at a meeting on 081113 in Paris did not reach agreement on further actions to persuade Iran to halt uranium enrichment at Iran 's facility in Natanz .
Uranium enrichment is a highly technical process that can produce fuel for a nuclear power plant or fissile material for atomic weapons .
The 081113 meeting ended without any new measures to announce .
After the 081113 meeting the French foreign ministry released a statement declaring the international community had reaffirmed the importance of the dual - track approach of engaging diplomatically with Iran and working towards sanctions .
Russia and China have resisted new sanctions against Iran .
Russia and China have close political and business ties with Iran and feel no domestic pressure to act against the Islamic Republic of Iran .
The United States does not have close political and business ties with Iran and feels domestic pressure to act against the Islamic Republic of Iran .
Russia and China hold veto power over Security Council decisions .
Moscow 's Interfax news agency quoted Russian diplomat Sergei ryabkov as stating that the parties struck no deal on sanctions against Iran at the 081113 meeting and that the Western countries are in favor of the sanctions against Iran while China and Russia did not support sanctions against Iran .
Sergei ryabkov attended the 081113 meeting .
A report released this week says Iran has made significant progress at Iran 's heavy - water research reactor facility near the city of Arak .
Iran 's heavy - water research reactor near Arak could eventually produce plutonium that might be used in a nuclear weapon .
Satellite images published by the Institute for Science and International Security show construction at the heavy - water research reactor facility near the city of Arak has progressed significantly between 080200 and 081000 .
David Albright stated that Iran 's heavy - water research reactor near Arak has evaded the international security community 's notice .
David Albright stated that Iran 's heavy - water research reactor near Arak is making significant progress according to the satellite images and that in a year and a half the heavy - water research reactor near Arak has progressed from building frames to a largely finished facility .
David Albright is a former arms inspector and Director of the Institute for Science and International Security that is based in Washington , D.C. .
Iran stated that Iran is pursuing nuclear technology to produce energy and conduct research .
The United States and its western allies suspect that Iran 's efforts to produce is a precursor to creating a nuclear - weapons infrastructure .
Low - grade uranium production is legal under international arms - control regulations .
The latest developments in Iran 's nuclear technology development show the complex diplomatic and technical challenges facing the incoming foreign policy team of United States President - elect Barack Obama when it takes on the task of stopping Iran from mastering technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons .
The administration of United States President George W. Bush in its last months in power has managed to synchronize United States policies with the European Union , British , French and German leaders , to press for tougher sanctions and diplomatic action against Iran .
The International Atomic Energy Agency is expected to release a report critical of Iran next week .
The International Atomic Energy Agency is the United Nations 's nuclear watchdog agency .
Due to the Act that no new initiatives regarding Iran 's nuclear program emerged from the 081113 Paris talks the hopes of imposing another set of United Nations Security Council sanctions before the end of President Bush 's term were decreasing .
While diplomatic maneuvering is taking place Iran continues to work towards mastering nuclear and missile technology .
Some Israeli officials have stated their alarm about Iran 's test - firing this week of a solid - fuel , two - stage rocket with a range of 1200 miles .
The city of Tel Aviv is fewer than 650 miles from Iranian territory .

A high - security Russian laboratory complex storing anthrax , plague and other deadly bacteria faces loosing electricity for lack of payment to the mosenergo electric utility .
A large repository of anthrax , plague and other deadly bacteria stored in a high - security Russian laboratory complex 100 miles south of Moscow is facing the threat of loosing electricity .
An official from the Moscow region 's mosenergo electric utility arrived recently at the Russian laboratory complex and threatened to turn off the electricity for lack of payment .
The Russian laboratory complex is a 90 - building campus and served as the location for Russia 's secret biological weapons program in the Soviet era .
An incorrect headline in the newspaper Izvestia stated that deadly viruses from a Moscow regional depository threaten Moscow .
There are no viruses at the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology in obolensk .
At the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology there is every kind of deadly bacteria that was studied for use in the secret biological weapons program of the Soviet Union .
A large virus repository is located in Siberia .
Both Russian and Western officials have stated that it is unlikely that any public health threat would result from a power cutoff at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology .
Russian and Western officials have stated that there is enough uncertainty that they could not be positive a loss of power at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology would not cause a public health threat .
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology has quite reliable systems of protection in case of emergency .
General Nikolai N. Urakov is the longtime director of the the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology .
The State scientific center of applied microbiology has been working with Western scientists to convert the complex into a biomedical manufacturing site .
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the people at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology are scared by this threat of a sudden shutdown of electricity because it is a kind of psychological pressure on the people at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology .
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that in the event of a power shutdown at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology scientists must destroy all bacteriological experiments under way .
General Nikolai N. Urakov would like the United States and Western countries that have contributed about 6 million United States dollars to the transformation of the former bioweapons complex to contribute another 500000 United States dollars per year to pay the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology 's electric bills and arrears .
An American scientist who works closely with the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology stated that the Russian government was responsible for paying for the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology 's electric bills .
Western aid for conversion of General Nikolai N. Urakov 's one time bioweapons laboratory peaked in 970000 because it was learned that Iran had made offers to the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology to purchase its expertise .
Russian scientists and military leaders who now depend on Western financing to destroy nuclear , chemical and biological weapons have been known to orchestrate a sense of crisis to increase financing .
American scientist Randall Lee Beatty is working on the conversion of the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology in obolensk .
Beatty stated that this threat to cut electricity to the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology is a crisis .
Randall Lee Beatty is a Director of the International Science and Technology Center .
The International Science and Technology Center finances approximately half of General Nikolai N. Urakov 's budget to support about 350 Russian biowarfare scientists and technicians .
Randall Lee Beatty stated that it is known that the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology has not paid its electricity bill for 14 months .
Randall Lee Beatty stated that the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology is one of the important archives for dangerous pathogens in the world and it would be a shame if those archives were destroyed for not paying the electricity utility .
Approximately 3000 strains of bacteria are stored at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology and many of the bacteria are stored in cryogenic casks cooled with liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment by layered enclosures and oversize air - handling systems that all depend on electricity to function .
The greatest danger from a shutdown of electric power at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology would be the defrosting of live germs that are currently preserved in a frozen state .
A biological warfare expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies named Raymond zilinskas stated that the main threat from cutting power to the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology would be to the organisms themselves rather than that they might escape .
Raymond zilinskas stated that in the worst case the bacteria would be defrosted from minus 70 degrees and it would be a real mess to clean up afterward because it would not be known for certain whether all the bacteria was dead .
The confrontation between the mosenergo electric utility and the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology in obolensk is another example of how the basic capitalist imperative for enterprises to be self - sustaining can clash in a dangerous way with the old remnants of Soviet weapons science .
Due to an overdue power bill in 000000 the Russian National Power Company cut off electricity to a strategic base where nuclear missiles stood on high alert .
The nuclear missile silos themselves did not lose power .
Armed troops marched to the substations and turned the power back on .
In 010100 and 010200 the national utility , United energy systems cut power to a number of military installations around Russia .
The military installations that lost power included the Russian space forces monitoring center on the Kamchatka Peninsula .
In most cases of military installations having their electricity cut off the electricity has been quickly restored .
Often investigations show that the tug of war with the utility forces the military to spend budgeted funds for electrical power instead of diverting money for other uses .
Some of the budgeted funds cut at times have included the building country residences for generals .

Brazil to implement law allowing air force to target drug trafficking aircraft in Brazilian airspace .
US concerned over liability in the event of misidentification of a civilian plane .
Brazil announced that the air force will begin shooting down aircraft used in trafficking illegal drugs in Brazilian airspace .
The plan requires 8 precautionary steps before the order to shoot down a plane may be issued .
Prior to the policy taking effect late 20041000 a publicity campaign will notify ranchers and others of the need to file flight plans .
The Law to permit such an action was originally approved in 1998 but 1995-2003 President Fernando Henrique Cardoso never put the policy into effect .
The United States dissuaded Cardoso from signing the decree out of concern that the accidental downing of civilian aircraft could expose the US government and companies to lawsuits .
20010400 the United States reduced previous support for operations targeting drug - running aircraft when a Peruvian jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed an American missionary and her child .
Relatives of the victims sued the US government and won a settlement due to the Government 's provision of intelligence and technical support to the operation .
A US State Department official stated --
US law may forbid assistance to countries that implement shoot - down laws under certain conditions .
The US agrees with the Brazilian assessment that the threat posed by drug traffickers is both very serious and increasing .
The US government has consulted the Brazilian Government about the provisions of US law .
Brazilian Defense Minister Jose Viegas stated that Brazil has encountered difficulties in securing US support for the plan but recent bilateral talks led to certainty that the decree would be accepted by the US government without exposing Brazil to commercial sanctions .
Brazilian officials have expressed hope that the policy will be endorsed by the US before going into effect .
The US is scheduled to provide 10.2 million dollars in drug and law enforcement aid to Brazil in 2004 .
Former air force chief and current Director of the Air Institute at estacio de sa University in Rio de Janeiro General Mauro Jose Miranda gandra stated that the measure was a courageous step by the Government but the impact may be more political than practical because of self - imposed restrictions by the Brazilian government .
Brazilian officials stated that the policy would be inapplicable against aircraft with children on board .
Viegas stated that the limitation was necessary .
Gandra stated that the provision undermines the decree 's essential purpose by granting immunity to drug - smuggling aircraft carrying children and thus introducing the possibility of kidnapped children being used as human shields .
Viegas stated in an interview in Brasilia that the government will use the law to more powerfully dissuade drug traffickers who have previously entered Brazilian airspace feeling unthreatened by the air force .
The Government was prompted to act due to the deteriorating public security situation with increasingly powerful and violent drug gangs in Sao Paolo and particularly Rio de Janeiro .
Rio de Janeiro drug gangs have more firepower than the police and have successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close .
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stated in a 2003 interview with foreign correspondents --
The policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security .
Some pilots of drug - running aircraft felt so confidently immune from retribution as to make obscene gestures at pursuing Brazilian air force pilots .
The constitutionality of the law has been questioned under Brazil 's prohibition of the death penalty as punishment for criminal acts .
Some legal experts and other commentators stated that contrary to government claims , the Statute amounts to a de facto execution of drug traffickers .
The daily newspaper O Estado de Sao Paolo stated in an editorial the week of 20040718-20040824 -- the extreme measure raises ethical and juridical problems exceeding any potential benefits .
The penalty will be applied extrajudicially by administrative decision of the Commander of the Air Force .
This person will gain life and death power over crew members and passengers of irregular flights .
In 2002 Brazil inaugurated the 1.4 billion dollar SIVAM radar system allowing the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansive Amazon region for the first time .
The system uses American technology .
Illegal Flights initially declined 30 percent due to trafficker 's concerns about improved tracking capabilities but subsequently reaccelerated .
Brazil recorded 4128 unauthorized flights in 2003 .
Some of these flights were innocent violations by ranchers in the Amazon flying between plantations .
Viegas stated that there was a significant increase in deliberate violations of Brazilian airspace , apparently by drug smugglers realizing that the government was incapable of retaliation .
20010400 Rio de Janeiro 's most notorious drug boss , Fernandinho Beira - Mar , was captured in Colombia in a guns - for drugs pipeline involving left - wing guerrillas .
Brazil 's northern Amazon corridor has become an increasingly busy and essential route in the global drug trade and is used for smuggling arms , gold and diamonds .
Reportedly one of the most important drug - and gun - smuggling routes in supplying Europe with cocaine runs from Colombia across the northern tier of the Amazon to Suriname .
Colombia is the only country that currently has a policy of targeting drug trafficking aircraft .
Colombia is the source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the United States .

The Venezuelan president 's weapons deals with Russia , curbs on military cooperation with the United States , and his plans to train as many as 2 million Venezuelan civilians to repel a possible invasion by superpowers have the US and his domestic critics worried .
Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez 's weapons deals with Russia , curbs on military cooperation with the United States , and plans to train as many as 2 million Venezuelan civilians to repel a possible invasion by imperialist superpowers have the United States and Chavez 's domestic critics worried about what the leftist former military officer is planning .
Chavez insists that the moves are purely defensive and born of an overdue need to update obsolete military hardware and protect Venezuela from nations that might want to take control of Venezuela .
Venezuela is South America 's largest petroleum - producing state .
Chavez 's domestic opponents scoff at the idea that the US would ever invade Venezuela and charge that Chavez 's true intention is to arm a huge cadre of loyal reservists who would protect Chavez against any internal uprising and to pose as a militarized counterweight to US influence in Latin America .
Cuban leader Fidel Castro is Chavez 's his major ally and Chavez is growing closer to Castro .
Chavez 's detractors in the US government say that it is even more troubling that Chavez 's arms purchases and indoctrination of civilian militias could be part of a strategy to restructure Venezuelan democracy in the image of Cuban - style militarized socialism and foment leftist revolutions throughout South America .
US military strategists say they are increasingly concerned that radical movements inspired by Chavez could foment such revolution .
The political mainstream in Latin America has shifted leftward since the late 1990s .
This leftward shift is largely in reaction to the perceived failure of free - market economics .
Leftists have been elected to lead Brazil , Argentina , Chile , Uruguay , Ecuador and Venezuela .
Chavez 's supporters at home counter that the United States has a century - long history of open as well as covert armed intervention in Latin America 's domestic politics and say that it has no right to question Venezuela 's defense preparations .
Carlos Roque Espinoza Leon said that Venezuelans never ask what the US Marines are doing .
Espinoza Leon is a pro - Chavez defense specialist who serves in Venezuela 's National Assembly .
Espinoza said that Peru has 500000 rifles and no one says anything .
Espinoza said no one complains that Colombia is the most militarized country in Latin America .
Espinoza said US history is full of aggression in Latin America .
Espinoza said Venezuelans have to do whatever is necessary to protect Venezuela .
Chavez has famously said that the Venezuelan so - called Bolivarian revolution is peaceful but not unarmed .
Chavez was first elected in 980000 and has a popularity rating of 71 percent in an independent poll by polling firm Datanalisis .
Venezuelan military analyst Alberto Garrido said Chavez is looking for allies in Russia , China , and Iran in order to promote a multi - polar world which will counteract US dominance and encourage grassroots Movements in Latin America to throw off US governmental influence .
Lorenzo Campos is a farmer in Anzoategui state in northern Venezuela and is training as a reservist .
Campos said Venezuelans want the world to know that Venezuelans are not preparing to attack anyone and that the mission is to protect Venezuela .
In May , Chavez 's government announced details in 050500 of an $ 18.6 million deal with a Russian firm to purchase 100000 AK - 103 assault rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition each and the technology transfer for Venezuela to manufacture the rifles .
The deal works out to $ 186.22 per rifle .
This price is considerably less costly than the US mail - order price of $ 825 to $ 850 for the same weapon .
The Government of Venezuela also intends to buy 10 Russian helicopters , 10 Spanish transport planes , and 6 Spanish naval craft .
Venezuelan officials say the government is negotiating with Brazil to buy around 24 air support and training planes .
Chavez has insisted and even his staunchest retired military Critics here agree that the purchases are essential to update old weaponry such as the military 's decades - old Belgian FAL rifles .
Retired General Fernando OCHOA ANTICH said that it is an exaggeration to say Chavez is engaged in an arms buildup .
Ochoa was defense minister in 920000 when then - Lieutenant Colonel Chavez launched a failed coup .
Ochoa stated that Venezuela has n't purchased arms in 25 years and said and Chavez is not aggressively buying weapons in a way that would threaten his neighbors .
Ochoa said Venezuela has never bought Russian arms before and suggested Chavez is doing it to become independent from the US .
Ochoa asked why Chavez is buying a caliber of rifle which is popular among subversive forces in Latin America and stated that the political support Chavez gives to radical leftist movements makes Chavez a continental menace .
The US Pentagon has openly questioned what Chavez will do with the old FAL rifles and whether Chavez might share weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in Latin America .
The US government has provided no evidence of Chavez arming or funding leftist insurgencies .
Military analysts and specialists on the Colombian FARC guerrillas say the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and would not be interested in old Belgian rifles or in assistance from Chavez .
A 030000 study published by the US Defense Intelligence Agency reported that more than half of the weapons seized from Colombian guerrillas from 980000 to 010000 that had markings of foreign militaries were of Venezuelan origin .
The implication was that corrupt or sympathetic members of the Venezuelan military may be aiding guerrillas .
Perhaps more distressing to Chavez 's domestic opponents is the ideological training that critics say Chavez has in mind for the military and for new civilian reservists .
Chavez called earlier in 050000 for so - called Revolutionary units to start preparing the public to resist a superpower aggressor and said the first step would be to train from 100000 to 2 million volunteers in the coming years to back up active - duty armed forces .
Military analysts estimate Venezuela 's active - duty armed forces number 83,000 .
People 's defense units would be created in neighborhoods , State companies , and the Free University established under Chavez and would report directly to the president .
The government insists the reserves will support the armed forces and not act as a fifth column against a possible anti - Chavez coup .
Espinoza said the reserves are not to be used as shock troops for any political party and that if there were a civil war , it would be up to each person to take their own side .
General Julio Ramon Quintero viloria is commander of the reserves .
Quintero said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50000 civilians over 20 weekends in the second half of 050000 and could train 300000 more in 060000 .
Quintero said that Venezuelans do n't want to be the colony of any empire and have to be ready for any possibility .
100000 reservists in 050600 engaged with the Venezuelan navy in a massive war game to repel a stronger country that had invaded .
40 employees of the state oil company participated in a similar exercise with 1200 soldiers in 050600 .
Pro - Chavez circles here warn of asymmetrical warfare .
Asymmetrical warfare is a term coined by US military strategists to describe a conflict between unequal combatants where the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics .
The US government has given $ 3.3 billion in mostly military aid to Colombia in the past 5 years .
Chavez loyalists fear that the US government could instigate a proxy war between Colombia and Venezuela as a way to oust Chavez and control Venezuelan oil .
A senior US official in an interview dismissed the notion that the United States Government wants to invade Venezuela as complete and utter nonsense .
The official said the chavista side wishes to make the relationship negative because they 've made a political calculation that Mr. Chavez reached power by constantly being in confrontation with the US .
Another development that has troubled the United States is Chavez 's rollback of military cooperation and joint exercises .
The US military had a Cooperation Office for 50 years in a Venezuelan Fort .
Chavez shut it down in 040000 .
5 US military trainers and students participating in an exchange program were ordered to leave the country in 050400 .
Analysts say that it is likely Chavez is trying to indoctrinate his public and armed forces .
Analysts say that there is no proof that Chavez will use those forces to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere .

Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill stated on 18 June 2007 that the North Korean government may be prepared to begin shutting down a plutonium producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step toward disabling the Unit by December 2007 .
Hill is the head American negotiator on North Korea 's nuclear weapons program .
Hill stated stalled efforts to dismantle North Korea 's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the weekend of 16 June 2007 and 17 June 2007 when Pyongyang officials invited inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit for talks on verifying and monitoring a shutdown .
Following talks with Chinese negotiator Wu Dawei Hill stated the shutdown has long been anticipated .
Hill stated the shutdown could occur in a matter of weeks not months .
The Associated Press reported from Vienna , Austria that the IAEA stated on 18 June 2007 that a team would visit Pyongyang the week of 24 June 2007 to discuss the manner in which inspectors will verify the shutdown .
Hill stated IAEA inspectors will hold talks with Pyongyang officials on sealing the reactor which would include the installation of television monitors at the site .
North Korean officials refused to proceed with a February 2007 agreement to begin decommissioning the Yongbyon reactor until funds worth 25 million dollars in accounts linked to North Korea held in a Macao Bank were transferred to North Korea .
The money was frozen when officials from the United States accused the Banco Delta Asia of complicity in financial crimes on behalf of North Korea .
The funds were wired on 14 June 2007 to the New York Federal Reserve Bank after months of disagreement over the method of returning the funds .
The funds were to be sent to Russia 's Central Bank before a transfer to an account controlled by the North Korea government in a Russian commercial bank .
Hill stated talks will occur the week of 17 June 2007 with disarmament negotiators from Russia , South Korea and Japan on steps to recoup some of the time lost while the financial transfer was being organized .
The discussions will also involve setting a timetable for resumption of 6 - nation arms control talks .
Under the agreement reached in February 2007 North Korean officials pledged to shut down the Yongbyon reactor and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for a 50000 - ton shipment of fuel oil .
North Korean officials will declare all nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for a further 950000 tons of fuel oil in the next phase of the Agreement .
Hill stated the technical possibility of concluding the next phase of the agreement by December 2007 .

A list from the Nuclear Suppliers Group shows that Iran has been denied purchases of nuclear - related materials approximately 75 times since 1998 because of suspicions the purchases could have been used for building bombs .
The 45 - nation Nuclear Suppliers Group is an offshoot of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and is charged with monitoring international trade to ensure that nuclear technology transferred for peaceful purposes is not directed to military use .
The Nuclear Suppliers Group is composed of technologically advanced countries .
According to the Nuclear Suppliers Group 's mission statement countries act on an individual basis to block trades that violate export controls devised to maintain international cooperation on peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
The Nuclear Suppliers Group has no enforcement power beyond notifying companies of violating the group 's guidelines .
The Nuclear Suppliers Group keeps data private and meets largely in secret .
Most of the denials of purchase have occurred since 2002 and have resulted from interventions by members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group .
The list of trade denials was made available by a diplomat from a country interested in exposing the extent of Iranian efforts to acquire so - called dual - use items that can be converted to weapons production .
The list was made available on condition that neither the diplomat nor the diplomat 's country be identified .
The list names companies from Australia , Finland , Sweden , the United Arab Emirates and Iran that were prevented from carrying out deals because the items being sold were suspected of being militarily useful .
The listed items being offered for sale in the blocked deals included Nickel powder , petrochemical plant components , compressors , furnaces , steel flanges and fittings , electron microscopes , radiometric ore - sorting machines , valves and tubing , lasers , a rotary drilling rig , a mass spectrometer and a nitrogen production plant .
The Iranian end users included the Government of Iran and Iran 's Atomic Energy Organization , power companies , engineering , petrochemical and oil - refining and gas companies , aircraft industries , schools , universities , engine manufacturers , mineral research centers , a helicopter support company and a plasma physics center .
The diplomat stated the 75 denials represented actions by only 7 of the 45 member States .
The diplomat stated the actual number of denials of sales of dual - use products to Iran is probably much higher than 75 .
Western diplomats stated that the government in Tehran uses front companies to receive and convert technology to weapons production without being detected as the standoff with Iran over Iran 's nuclear program has continued .
Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty but not a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group .

Iranian News Agency Fars stated that hackers known as group XP defaced or blocked 100s of Shiite - related websites .
The official website of Iraq 's Shiite leader the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani was among the websites defaced and blocked .
Group XP stated on the defaced website that any website that contained material contrary to Sunni teachings would be hacked .
The official website of Iraq 's Shiite religious leader the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani was defaced and blocked in a sectarian - motivated cyber attack on Shiite - related sites .
It was not clear whether the attack began on 18 September 2008 or the morning of 19 September 2008 .
By the evening of 19 September 2008 Al-Sistani 's website was offline .
Another website related to 1 of Al-Sistani 's religious organizations , www.al-shia.com , was also affected .
An alternative address , www.sistani.com , was still operational .
Iranian News Agency Fars stated that group XP had blocked access to approximately 300 Shiite - related sites on 18 September 2008 and 19 September 2008 .
Neither the hacking claim nor an Iranian assertion that group XP was based in the United Arab Emirates could be verified independently .
Several Iranian news sites stated on 19 September 2008 that many of the Shiite and Iran - related web sites that had been attacked were running normally again .
A statement signed group XP was posted on the home page of Al-Sistani 's web site and stated that the attack was on behalf of Sunni Muslims .
The statement said --
Group XP had carried out similar attacks on other Shiite sites in the Persian Gulf and Iraq .
Group XP erased the site as group XP has done with other Rafidha sites .
Rafidha means rejecters and is an insult used by Sunni extremists to describe Shiites .
Al-Sistani promoted sexual deviance and an Iranian agenda in Iraq as Al-Sistani was born in Iran .
Any website with material that was contrary to Sunni teachings would be punished .
The statement also consisted of a youtube video clip of American comedian bill Maher ridiculing a fatwa by Al-Sistani on whether certain positions of sexual intercourse were permitted for married couples .
The ayatollah 's office in Najaf declined to comment on the cyber attack .
Fars reported that a counterattack had been carried out against 2 major Wahhabi web sites which belong to puritanical strain of Sunni Islam that is dominant in Saudi Arabia .

Somali pirates who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms are approaching a deal for the ship 's release .
Questions have emerged regarding the shipment of arms en route to Kenya and of a possible clandestine arms deal between Kenya and South Sudan .
On 08 October 2008 Maritime officials and associates of the Somali pirates who on 25 September 2008 hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms stated that the pirates may soon be collecting their ransom .
After difficult negotiations likened by several people involved to bazaar - style haggling the parties are close to reaching a deal in which the pirates would be paid millions of dollars and the ship freed .
A businessman in xarardheere , Somalia named Ahmed Omar stated that the pirates and the ship owners have agreed on a ransom of approximately 8 million U.S. dollars and the ship may be freed on 08 October 2008 or 09 October 2008 .
Xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on the coast of Somalia .
Maritime officials in Kenya stated that critical details have yet to be agreed upon .
One such detail involves the pirates ' request for a guarantee that they would not be arrested or attacked by the armada of American warships currently encircling them .
A Kenyan maritime official stated anonymously that such negotiations are complex and involve more than the financial aspect .
On 08 October 2008 the official stated that progress is being made and the parties are approaching an agreement .
The pirates initially requested 35 million U.S. dollars and then reduced their request to 20 million U.S. dollars .
The pirates have consistently expressed willingness to negotiate the financial figures .
More than 25 ships have been hijacked in 2008 off the Somalia coast with a typical ransom of between 1 and 2 million U.S. dollars .
The pirates aboard the Ukrainian ship have stated that upon receipt of payment in American dollars and preferably in 100 dollar bills the ship , its cargo and the 20 sailors on board will be released .
The original country of destination for the arms shipment aboard the Ukrainian ship is being questioned .
Shortly after the freighter was hijacked on 25 September 2008 the Kenyan government claimed that the weapons on board were being shipped for Kenya 's military .
The ship was en route to Kenya 's main port of Mombasa .
The weapons on board the ship included 33 T - 72 tanks , 150 grenade launchers , 6 anti - aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition .
Evidence has subsequently emerged that the weapons were part of a clandestine arms deal between Kenya and the separatist region of southern Sudan .
The deal would most likely have remained secret had the pirates not hijacked the ship and begun speaking to the media by satellite phone .
Ukrainian officials have been adamant in denying any wrongdoing .
Ukrainian diplomat in Kenya oleh belokolos stated --
Ukraine does not supply or have plans to supply any armaments to the Government of South Sudan .
All the appropriate paperwork has been validated .
Ukraine abides by all United Nations rules and arms control agreements .
Ukraine inherited enormous stockpiles of weaponry after the collapse of the Soviet Union and is now a major arms dealer .
The deal with Ukraine is considered suspicious given that Kenya has mostly relied on the United Kingdom and other western countries for its supply of heavy weapons .
Kenyan politicians were demanding answers and have called for several commissions to examine the situation .
Southern Sudan is an autonomous region that is currently increasing its military and that uses Soviet - designed tanks .
The American military stated that its priority is to ensure that the weapons were not unloaded from the ship and sold to Islamist insurgents in Somalia .
The pirates have denied interest in the weapons and claimed to have been unaware that the cargo included tanks when they hijacked the ship .
Pirate spokesman sugule Ali stated in an interview last week that the pirates ' sole interest in the deal is money .

Head of the U.N. drug office Antonio Maria Costa said that Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency .
Head of the U.N. drug office Antonio Maria Costa said that Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency .
Costa said this to reporters last week as the U.N. Drug Office Office prepared to release its latest survey of Afghanistan 's opium crop .
The survey showed that poppy cultivation had retreated in much of Afghanistan and was overwhelmingly concentrated in 7 of 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strong , most of those in the south .
The survey was issued November 27 , 2008 .
The United Nations found that the result was a 19 percent reduction in the amount of land devoted to opium in Afghanistan even though the total tonnage of opium produced dropped by just 6 percent .
The study stated that the high output per acre was attributed to a good growing season in the south .
The southern region is a heavily irrigated area where the Taliban maintained a strong presence in 5 provinces and have systematically encouraged opium cultivation as a way to finance their insurgency for several years .
The U.N. estimates the insurgents made as much as 300 million dollars from the opium trade last year .
Costa said a lot of war effort can be funded with 2 to 300 million dollars .
The Taliban have producing an amount of opium that far exceeds world demand due to 3 successive years of bumper crops .
Costa said the result was a glut that was depressing the price , which dropped by approximately 20 percent .
Costa said that the fact that prices had not collapsed already was evidence that the Taliban , drug lords and even some farmers have stockpiled the opium .
An increasing amount is also being processed in Afghanistan .
Costa added that insurgents have been holding significant amounts of opium .
Costa said the surplus is as much as 11000 tons , or more than twice world demand in the last 3 years and threatened to devalue their stockpiles .
The United Nations found that Afghanistan produced 8500 tons of opium in 2008 .
World demand was estimated at about 4400 tons per year .
The Taliban this year are taking a passive stance toward cultivation and putting less pressure on Afghan farmers to plant opium poppy .
This then supports the current price .
Costa is an Italian diplomat who has served at the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime for 6 years .
