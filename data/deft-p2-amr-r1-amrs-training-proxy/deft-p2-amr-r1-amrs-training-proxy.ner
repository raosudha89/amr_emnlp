Canadian government 's warning of al-Qaeda 's capability to launch a cyberattack causes various industries to review their preparedness .
Critical infrastructures including energy and transportation providers cite close work with <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> to remain aware of threats and to update accordingly .
A recent government warning that al-Qaeda terrorists could launch a cyberattack on Canadian interests or critical infrastructure has caused many concerned industries to review their security systems .
Vice President of Canadian electricity Association <PERSON>Francis Bradley</PERSON> stated that the company has a warning system for both physical and cyberattacks .
Bradley stated that the company has been significantly focused on prevention of cyberattacks .
In a recent interview <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> stated that many utility firms perform a brief review of their multi - tiered response systems after such warnings are issued .
The warning from the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Department of National Defense</ORGANIZATION> 's office of critical infrastructure protection and emergency service was quietly released on 20 <DATE>December 2001</DATE> and cited no specific threat .
Director of threat analysis at the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Department of National Defense</ORGANIZATION> 's office of critical infrastructure protection and emergency service <PERSON>Brenda hensler</PERSON> - <PERSON>Hobbs</PERSON> stated that following the attacks of 11 <DATE>September 2001</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Canadian Government</ORGANIZATION> specifically examined the potential cyber - capability of al-Qaeda and <LOCATION>Osama</LOCATION> bin <ORGANIZATION>Laden</ORGANIZATION> 's followers .
<PERSON>Hensler</PERSON> - <PERSON>Hobbs</PERSON> stated that the Canadian government has no knowledge of Al-Qaeda having engaged in cyberattacks in the past but that leader bin Laden has suggested that if he chose to launch cyberattacks he could have the means available to him .
In summary of the recent warning stating that such an attack could be executed in the very near future hensler - <PERSON>Hobbs</PERSON> stated that bin <ORGANIZATION>Laden</ORGANIZATION> 's location was irrelevant because bin <ORGANIZATION>Laden</ORGANIZATION> possesses the money and supporters necessary to have such an attack executed by others .
A number of al-Qaeda militants including Millennium plot bomber <PERSON>Ahmed Ressam</PERSON> are known to have remained in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> .
Many are located in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> .
<PERSON>Hensler</PERSON> - <PERSON>Hobbs</PERSON> stated that the proliferation and availability of Hacker tools and the low skill level needed to conduct cyberattacks demonstrate the ease of launching an attack anywhere .
<PERSON>Hensler</PERSON> - <PERSON>Hobbs</PERSON> cited the example of the <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> - based Hacker known as mafiaboy who attacked <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> websites including <ORGANIZATION>Amazon.com</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>2000</DATE> .
Many think that security must be improved at North American critical infrastructures including energy and transportation providers and the financial services sector that are largely interconnected .
Many businesses began preparing for cyber incidents before the year <DATE>2000</DATE> .
A separate report issued recently by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government - funded research group computer science and telecommunications <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> stated that cyber security needs considerable improvement .
For example , according to a Canadian government estimate the love bug launched in <DATE>May 2000</DATE> caused 6.7 billion <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollars in damage and disrupted Canadian government systems .
Bell <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON>Andrew Cole</PERSON> stated that <LOCATION>Bell Canada</LOCATION> is prepared and remains prepared for various potential situations and scenarios .
Cole stated --
Bell <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> works very closely with the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> and the private sector to be aware of security concerns and to update accordingly .
Bell <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> worked closely with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials and firms after the attacks of 11 <DATE>September 2001</DATE> .
Bell <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> provides a total of 26 million phone and Internet connections to a nation of 30 million people .
Bradley stated --
Electricity firms have strong warning systems that are coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION>North American Electric reliability Council</ORGANIZATION> .
There has not been a cyber event that has resulted in a loss of power for utility customers .
There is little possibility that a cyberattack would disable a North American electric grid .
Electric companies are well prepared and are making all preparations required to be ready for any physical or cyberattack .
The <ORGANIZATION>North American Electric</ORGANIZATION> reliability <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> 's 30 largest utility companies went on their highest alert on <DATE>September 11</DATE> and many still have an increased security presence in effect and plan to extend it further .

Gilbert stated that the post - Soviet republics in central <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> fought terrorism by giving material and other necessary help to the international anti - terrorist coalition in the war against Saudi dissident <LOCATION>Osama</LOCATION> bin Laden and the Taliban regime .
Both <LOCATION>Tajikistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Uzbekistan</LOCATION> share a border with <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> and have experienced raids by <ORGANIZATION>Taliban</ORGANIZATION> - backed Islamic militants in recent years .
Neighboring <LOCATION>Kyrgyzstan</LOCATION> has also experienced raids by <ORGANIZATION>Taliban</ORGANIZATION> - backed Islamic militants in recent years .
<LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION> also became a key <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> partner in the Afghan war opening its airspace to military overflights .
Turkmenistan maintained a more neutral stance .

Gilbert stated that <LOCATION>Tajikistan</LOCATION> 's positive and responsible approach to the crisis in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> has significantly improved the country 's image internationally .
Tajik government expert and head of the <ORGANIZATION>Tajik Drug Control Agency Vladimir Rakhmonov</ORGANIZATION> stated on 10 <DATE>February 2002</DATE> that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> - led war in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> had failed to stop drug trafficking across the border into <LOCATION>Tajikistan</LOCATION> .
Rakhmonov stated to <ORGANIZATION>Interfax</ORGANIZATION> --
Opium and heroin are a form of hard - currency reserve for <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> .
Drug trafficking from <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> has been concealed so securely that it will be impossible to uncover .
Drug trafficking from <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> resumed during a brief hiatus in the anti - terrorist operation .
In <DATE>2001</DATE> Tajik law - enforcement agencies and Russian border guards seized 8.8 tons of drugs including 4.2 tons of heroin .
This represented a <PERCENT>26 percent</PERCENT> increase overall in <DATE>2001</DATE> with 3 times the amount of heroin .
Suggestions that there are no longer drug lords in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> and that drug traffic into <LOCATION>Tajikistan</LOCATION> has been eradicated are unrealistic and false .
Many years would be needed to convert <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> 's agriculture historically specialized in the growing of raw opium .
Cultivation of raw opium provided the only source of income for much of the rural population .
<LOCATION>Tajikistan</LOCATION> 's 780 - mile border with <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> is patrolled by approximately 11000 Russian soldiers under a <DATE>1992</DATE> agreement between the Russian and <ORGANIZATION>Tajik Governments</ORGANIZATION> .

Afghanistan 's interim government stated that it would take firm measures very quickly to prevent the harvest of poppy in the wake of the Taliban regime 's fall late last year .
Leader of <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> 's interim government <PERSON>Hamid Karzai</PERSON> said the fight against poppy harvesting and the lucrative trafficking of opium and heroin will be a top priority .
The anti - drug effort is strongly supported by Western countries , whose populations are a major market for heroin and opium from <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> .

<LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> 's defense ministry under attack in parliament over allegations it is favoring <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> company <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> for multi - billion - dollar fighter project .
Newspaper reports reveal that French - made plane was rated higher in air force evaluations and that the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> is instead responding to political pressure from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> .
<LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION> came under attack in <LOCATION>Parliament</LOCATION> on 04 <DATE>March 2002</DATE> over allegations that it is favoring <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> company <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> for a multi - billion - dollar fighter project .
Ruling and opposition lawmakers criticized the Ministry as newspapers reported that the French - made fighter Rafale had scored the highest marks of any of the 4 contenders in field tests performed by <ORGANIZATION>South Korean Air Force</ORGANIZATION> evaluators .
The 3.2 billion <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar project to buy 40 fighters will be one of the most important international military contracts awarded this year but it has encountered multiple obstacles .
Award of the contract was temporarily suspended in <DATE>February 2002</DATE> after the prices offered by 4 bidders were judged too high .
<LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> 's defense ministry promised to conclude its first - stage appraisal by the end of <DATE>March 2002</DATE> .
There has also been much newspaper speculation that the South Korean government might yield to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> pressure to buy <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> 's aged F - <DATE>15</DATE> k.
Speculation grew in <DATE>February 2002</DATE> when <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON>Kim Dong</PERSON> - <PERSON>Shin</PERSON> stressed that <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> should consider security ties with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in the project .
The other competing planes are the <ORGANIZATION>Dassault</ORGANIZATION> firm 's Rafale , the <ORGANIZATION>Eurofighter Consortium</ORGANIZATION> 's typhoon <DATE>2000</DATE> and the Russian Su - 32 made by Sukhoi .
<ORGANIZATION>Dassault</ORGANIZATION> is seeking its first foreign order for the Rafale .
<PERSON>Kang Chang</PERSON> - Sung of the opposition <ORGANIZATION>Grand National Party</ORGANIZATION> expressed doubt of the fairness of the evaluation methods stating that his party suspects that the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION> has political reasons to select the F - <DATE>15 k</DATE>.
The ruling <ORGANIZATION>Millennium Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> also accused the Ministry of favoring the F - <DATE>15</DATE> k despite the defense chief 's insistence that there was no favoritism toward <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> .
Kim stated --
There has been no pressure from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .
There would be an investigation into how classified documents had been leaked .
The <ORGANIZATION>Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION> was further pressured by numerous newspaper reports of the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> 's evaluation of the Rafale as excellent in all categories .
Newspapers stated that the F - <DATE>15</DATE> k was rated excellent in reliability and support combat capability but met only <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of core technology requirements .
Newspapers stated that the Eurofighter was rated excellent in general function and reliability categories but the Rafale also earned the excellent rating for its weapons and electronic warfare capability .
The Su - <DATE>35</DATE> placed fourth with ratings of ordinary in all five categories .
Rafale reportedly offered more generous terms for technology transfer and subcontracts for <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> 's aerospace industry .
The Ministry stated that the air force was just 1 of 4 evaluations .
Some analysts have stated that the study method is biased toward <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> noting that the evaluation was revised in <DATE>February 2002</DATE> to ensure that all 4 bidders would receive an automatic 60 points for technology transfer .
The English - language <ORGANIZATION>Korea Herald</ORGANIZATION> newspaper stated that this revision gives an advantage to <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> which has been reluctant to transfer core technology .
The <ORGANIZATION>Korea Herald</ORGANIZATION> stated that when evaluators were conducting their first - stage reports the ministry ordered them to give each bidder grades within a range of 60 to 100 points instead of 0 to 100 points .
The <ORGANIZATION>Korea Herald</ORGANIZATION> stated that critics say <ORGANIZATION>Boeing</ORGANIZATION> would benefit most from the points minimum because it would gain fewer points than <ORGANIZATION>Dassault</ORGANIZATION> in terms of technology transfer and subcontracts .

The consortium is to build 2 light water nuclear reactors that produce less weapons grade fuel than <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> 's old graphite reactors and provide substitute fuel until they are built .
The original 030000 target date for completion has been put back at least 5 years because of major political and construction delays .
The 940000 Accord stipulated that the <ORGANIZATION>International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> ) must be allowed to inspect <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> 's old facilities to see if plutonium has been processed before the core facilities of the new reactors are installed .

3 grams of heroin costs 70 somonis or <MONEY>30 dollars</MONEY> .
an addict is willing to commit any crime to pay for heroin .
Afghan heroin is the strongest in the world because it is made from poppies cultivated at high altitudes and therefore subjected to high doses of ultra - violet light .
A person who takes a daily dose of Afghan heroin has a life expectancy of between 5 and <DATE>7 years</DATE> and many commit suicide before that .
The <ORGANIZATION>Tajik State</ORGANIZATION> pays 25 dirams ( a few cents ) per day for every person in the rehabilitation clinics .
The percentage of relapses is very high due to the lack of followup treatment and unemployment among young people .

Min said <LOCATION>Myanmar</LOCATION> would be one of the richest countries in the region if they were as corrupt as outsiders claimed .
Hla Min stated that illicit drugs worth some <MONEY>50 billion dollars</MONEY> have been destroyed by authorities since <DATE>1974</DATE> .
Min said it was enough to pay <LOCATION>Myanmar</LOCATION> 's national debt ten times over .
Drug - burning ceremonies are regular events in <LOCATION>Myanmar</LOCATION> .
Critics argue that it does not reflect the massive drug industry in the country .
Resident Representative of the <ORGANIZATION>UN</ORGANIZATION> 's Drug Control Program ( <ORGANIZATION>UNDCP</ORGANIZATION> ) Jean - <PERSON>Luc Lemahieu</PERSON> said this one is different .
Almost 102 tons of poppy seeds were burnt in the capital of <LOCATION>Myanmar</LOCATION> 's northern Shan state at this ceremony .
The ceremony also included 249 kilograms of opium , 102 kilograms of morphine powder , three kilograms of solid morphine and various precursor chemicals .

In particular the largest armed drug militia in the world the <ORGANIZATION>United Wa State Army</ORGANIZATION> .
<LOCATION>Myanmar</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Home Minister Colonel Tin Hlaing</ORGANIZATION> said the success of project new destiny is evidenced by the tons of poppy seeds that have been turned in rather than seized .
Hlaing stated his confidence in the drug scourge that threatens the world will not find a place in <LOCATION>Myanmar</LOCATION> if the local population is committed to this sort of cooperation .
<PERSON>Lauk Kai</PERSON> is one of the regime 's showpieces for its previous crop substitution programs .
It has expanses of rubber trees , fruit orchards and paddy where poppies used to thrive .
The poppies yielded the raw ingredient for heroin .
<PERSON>Lauk Kai</PERSON> is located in the infamous Golden Triangle .
Reformed drug lord and leader of the <LOCATION>Kokang</LOCATION> phone <PERSON>Kyar Shin</PERSON> pledged commitment to the government program .

<ORGANIZATION>UNDCP</ORGANIZATION> 's Lemahieu when asked by AFP what impact project New Destiny had on the international community hoped it would have a positive impact and that some additional funds would come forward .
Lemahieu said so much depends on the political situation in this country .
There is hope for further political change following the <DATE>May 6</DATE> release of pro - democracy leader <LOCATION>Aung San Suu Kyi</LOCATION> from 19 months house arrest .
The regime seeks the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> approval for the project .

<LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> proposes expansion of anti - terrorism pact with <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>the Philippines</LOCATION> to entire <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> .
Terrorism is expanding across <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> .
The <ORGANIZATION>Malaysian Government</ORGANIZATION> proposes the expansion of an anti - terrorism pact with <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>the Philippines</LOCATION> to encompass the remainder of <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> .
Malaysian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Syed Hamid Albar</PERSON> stated that other members of <ORGANIZATION>the Association of Southeast Asian Nations</ORGANIZATION> ( ASEAN ) will be encouraged to accede to the pact at talks next week with <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> .
Syed Hamid stated that <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> had expressed interest in joining the pact .
Malaysian defense analyst dzirhan mahadzir stated --
Cooperation by poorer countries may be stymied by financial constraints and a perception that terrorism does not directly affect these countries .
An <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> pact is beneficial in the long - term but will be difficult to implement because national security issues and interstate rivalry may make some of <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> 's 10 members wary to divulge information .
ASEAN must agree on a definition of terrorism to identify the common enemy .
20020500 senior <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> members <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> signed an anti - terror security pact intended to initiate the eradication of terrorism from the region .
The 3 countries share sea borders frequently used by pirates and criminals in evading pursuing troops .
The pact includes plans to trace and freeze terror funds and exchange information to curb cross - border piracy , drug trafficking , illegal entry and illegal trafficking of women and children .
Syed Hamid stated that after 20010911 countries should exchange information that may affect transnational crime such as funds of terrorists that may be kept in other countries or third party information to combat the greater threat of international terrorism .
Mushahid Ali of the <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> - based <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Defense</ORGANIZATION> and Strategic Studies stated --
The trilateral pact between <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>the Philippines</LOCATION> constituted a constructive first step .
<LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> members must more proactively monitor terrorist activities and establish a concrete mechanism among national agencies for the protracted conflict .
20020500 <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> security ministers at a meeting in <LOCATION>Kuala Lumpur</LOCATION> failed to agree on a definition of terrorism but agreed to increase cooperation among <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> enforcement agencies and endorsed the use of detention without trial for suspected militants in <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> .
Objections were raised concerning <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> 's proposal to include <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> terrorism in the definition .
Dzirhan stated --
The agreement among <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>the Philippines</LOCATION> may have been aimed at ingratiating the countries to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> rather than combating terrorism .
Since the pact was signed no progress has occurred .
The creation of a formalized security structure in combating terror will be decelerated by the <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> 's model of acting on consensus .
Officials stated that after the meeting in <LOCATION>Brunei</LOCATION> 20020728-20020801 <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> and its major western trading partners are expected to demand freezing of terror funds and stronger counter - terrorism cooperation .
Dozens of suspected terrorists allegedly linked to al-Qaeda in <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>the Philippines</LOCATION> have revealed the existence of a regional Islamic militant group called the <ORGANIZATION>Jemaah Islamiyah</ORGANIZATION> , which also operates in <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> .

<ORGANIZATION>Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> director States it would be difficult for <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> to conceal a nuclear weapons program if international inspectors were allowed to return .
Inspectors would perform various tests , visits , and interviews and their presence alone in the country would be a deterrent .
On 18 <DATE>October 2002</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> ) director <PERSON>Mohamed ElBaradei</PERSON> stated it is unlikely that <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> could conceal a nuclear weapons program if it allowed international inspectors to return .
ElBaradei stated that once inspectors were working in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> their presence alone would be a deterrent to developing nuclear weapons .
ElBaradei stated to reporters at his headquarters in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> --
It is difficult to conceal a nuclear program if thorough inspections are performed because nuclear products always have a signature .
Traces are always visible if highly enriched uranium or plutonium were used .
ElBaradei stated that inspectors would perform environmental sampling , gamma radiation surveys from helicopters , internal periodic visits to all capable sites and interviews with all former nuclear scientists to confirm that they are not working in the nuclear program .
ElBaradei stated that the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> could not give a 100 percent guarantee but that the presence of inspectors would be a good deterrent and a good mechanism for detection .
ElBaradei stated --
It is necessary to control imports to <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> because of the risk that <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> is receiving nuclear material from outside the country .
There must be physical protection of all nuclear material particularly in the former <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> .
There must be strong unanimous support by the <ORGANIZATION>UN Security Council</ORGANIZATION> to force <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> to comply with <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> inspection .
The <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> must be given as much intelligence information as possible to guide inspectors to anything that should be inspected or to any item hidden from inspectors .

<LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION> 's main opposition leader <PERSON>Sheikh Hasina Wajed</PERSON> said 021102 that an army crackdown on crime was turning into a political witchhunt and targeting her <ORGANIZATION>Awami League</ORGANIZATION> party .
Troops were ordered into the streets more than 2 weeks ago to eliminate rampant crime but human rights groups claim fundamental rights are being trampled .
Newspapers and rights groups put the toll of those who have died in police and military custody at 16 .
Officials say more than 3400 people have been taken into custody since the crackdown began 021017 .
The government has confirmed the deaths of 12 people due to heart attacks .

The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government and <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> - based <ORGANIZATION>Amnesty International</ORGANIZATION> have also expressed concern about the custodial deaths .
Amnesty urged a prompt and fair investigation by an independent body into the deaths .
<PERSON>Sheikh Hasina</PERSON> told reporters at the airport on her return from a private trip to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> that initially it appeared to be a neutral anti - crime drive and the opposition <ORGANIZATION>Awami League</ORGANIZATION> party welcomed it .
<PERSON>Hasina</PERSON> said the crackdown is gradually turning into one to eliminate the <ORGANIZATION>Opposition</ORGANIZATION> .
Hasina wants the military to arrest real criminals and not violate <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION> 's constitution and human rights because of concern about such violations in the name of anti - crime drive .
<PERSON>Sheikh Hasina</PERSON> said the military has to operate within the laws of the land as no one is above the law .
Police said the army hadon 021101 arrested former state minister and <ORGANIZATION>Awami League</ORGANIZATION> lawmaker talukder Abdul khaleque in <LOCATION>southwestern Khulna</LOCATION> city soon after he spoke at a news conference against the deployment .
The Daily Star newspaper reported that an imam and a local leader of fundamentalist group <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat</ORGANIZATION> - e - Islami were also arrested on 021101 in <LOCATION>Khulna</LOCATION> .

Selim , <PERSON>Chowdhury</PERSON> and aurango are being detained under the strict 740000 Special Powers Act allowing detention for 120 days without charge .
<PERSON>Sheikh Hasina</PERSON> questioned how 3 of the <ORGANIZATION>Awami League</ORGANIZATION> party 's ex - ministers could be terrorists .
Hasina was apparently unaware of the claims of the arrest of the <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat</ORGANIZATION> leader when adding that it is an open secret that the <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat</ORGANIZATION> - e - Islami and the <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat</ORGANIZATION> - e - Islami student wing have weapons and wondering why none of the <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat</ORGANIZATION> - e - Islami has been arrested so far .
<PERSON>Hasina</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Awami League</ORGANIZATION> party would raise the issue when parliament reconvenes 021114 .
<LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION> 's Prime Minister <PERSON>Khaleda Zia</PERSON> 's Islamist - allied government includes 2 cabinet ministers from the <ORGANIZATION>Jamaat</ORGANIZATION> .

<LOCATION>New U.S.</LOCATION> study claims that one - tenth of Internet 's sites are blocked by the <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Government</ORGANIZATION> authorities using updated Filtering technology .
A wide range of sites including a very high percentage of news sites and keywords were found to be blocked .
A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> study released on 03 <DATE>December 2002</DATE> states that one - tenth of the Internet 's sites may be blocked by Chinese authorities as part of efforts to prevent access to information on dissidents , <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> and other subjects .
The study was conducted by <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION> 's berkman Center for Internet and society .
The study found that more than 50000 of the approximately 200000 websites tested were inaccessible from at least 1 point in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> on at least 1 occasion .
Using a more narrow definition of blocked site the study concluded that 18931 websites were being blocked to Chinese web users .
Harvard researcher and co - author of the report <PERSON>Ben Edelman</PERSON> stated that it is likely that similar percentages apply to the Internet as a whole .
<PERSON>Edelman</PERSON> told AFP that it is highly likely that approximately one - tenth of the Internet is filtered by or recently has been filtered by <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
Edelman stated that there are many different ways to measure this effect and therefore hesitated to specify any single proportion .
The latest study was broader than prior surveys and gives perspective to disparate reports about websites that are filtered or blocked by <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
In the report it is concluded that --
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> blocks a range of web content beyond that which is sexually explicit .
1000s of sites providing information about news , health , education , and entertainment were blocked .
Approximately 3284 sites from <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> were blocked .
The blocked sites also included those of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> news organizations including <ORGANIZATION>ABC News</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>CBS News</ORGANIZATION> , the Alta Vista search engine , and a number of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> universities .
The researchers found that <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> of the top 10 sites with keywords <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Taiwan China</LOCATION> , or equality were blocked .
A large number of other sites with keywords such as freedom , democracy and HIV were also blocked .
The <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> news site was consistently unavailable .
Sites for <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Time magazine</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> - based public broadcasting system , the <ORGANIZATION>Miami Herald</ORGANIZATION> , and the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> Inquirer were also often blocked .
The report found that 42 of <ORGANIZATION>google</ORGANIZATION> 's top 100 results for news were blocked .
Religious sites blocked in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> included the <ORGANIZATION>Asian American Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION> , The atheist network , the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Civil Rights League</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Feng Shui</PERSON> , the Jewish Federation of <LOCATION>Winnipeg</LOCATION> , and the <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION> Zen center .
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has an estimated 45 million Internet users .
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has been widely criticized in the West for blocking websites and for imprisoning people for viewing banned sites or using the Internet for anti - government activities .
The Chinese government is believed to routinely block a large number of foreign - based sites primarily those featuring dissident views or banned groups such as the Falungong spiritual organization but also certain foreign news sites and pages showing pornography .
A recent report by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> - based <ORGANIZATION>Rand Corporation</ORGANIZATION> think tank found that the Chinese government now uses more technology to filter out objectionable content rather than relying solely on surveillance of users and seizure of equipment as it did in the past .
The rand report released earlier in <DATE>2002</DATE> found that Chinese authorities now appear to have more effective technology for filtering out undesirable content .

<LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> urges <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> to return nuclear reactor to UN surveillance .
<LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> had violated <DATE>1994</DATE> shut down by disabling surveillance devices .
20021222 <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> urged <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> to return the <LOCATION>Yongbyon</LOCATION> nuclear reactor to UN surveillance in order to deescalate the nuclear crisis on the <LOCATION>Korean Peninsula</LOCATION> .
20021221 the <ORGANIZATION>UN International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> ) stated that <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> had disabled <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> surveillance devices by breaking seals on <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> equipment and blocking surveillance cameras at the country 's 5 megawatt nuclear reactor .
20021221 <ORGANIZATION>IAEA Director General General Mohammed ElBaradei</ORGANIZATION> expressed regret over <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> 's actions .
A <ORGANIZATION>South Korean Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> official stated --
The development is regrettable and will increase tension over <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> 's nuclear weapons program .
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> should act jointly with <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> .
The <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> stated that <PERSON>ElBaradei</PERSON> warned the government of <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> not to take further action that would prevent the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> from monitoring compliance with the <DATE>1994</DATE> accord with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> shutting down the reactor .
20041212 <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> stated that the country 's plutonium - producing nuclear program would recommence in order to produce energy due to a global embargo on oil shipments .
In <DATE>1994</DATE> the reactor was frozen under an accord in exchange for 500000 tons of fuel oil annually from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .
The accord additionally formed a consortium to build 2 light - water reactors .
International experts stated that the <LOCATION>Yongbyon</LOCATION> reactor was used to produce weapons - grade plutonium .
After the <DATE>1994</DATE> closing approximately <DATE>8000</DATE> spent fuel rods from the reactor were sealed in metal casings in cooling ponds .
20041000 the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> revealed that <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> had admitted to implementing a nuclear program based on enriched uranium , a material for nuclear weapons .

<LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> removed UN seals at a laboratory suspected of being used to produce weapons - grade material .
This activity further escalates tension in the <LOCATION>Korean Peninsula</LOCATION> 's nuclear crisis and ignores international condemnation .
A source close to the <ORGANIZATION>International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> ) said late on 021223 the North had started stripping the UN nuclear regulation group 's seals and monitoring equipment from the laboratory at <LOCATION>Yongbyon</LOCATION> .
The lab is suspected of having reprocessed fuel rods for weapons - grade plutonium before its activities were frozen under a 940000 arms control deal with the <ORGANIZATION>United Sates</ORGANIZATION> .
The source is fully informed of <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> activities in <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> and said the <LOCATION>North Koreans</LOCATION> are cutting the seals of the nuclear fuel reprocessing laboratory and could complete it possibly by 021224 .
The move followed similar actions 021221-021222 at the <LOCATION>Yongbyon</LOCATION> nuclear facility during which the North Korean government took control of 1000s of spent fuel rods that could be used to make nuclear weapons .
The nuclear crisis dominated the first meeting between South Korean President <PERSON>Kim Dae</PERSON> - Jung and President - elect <PERSON>Roh Moo</PERSON> - hyun earlier 021223 .
Kim and <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> were meeting for the first time since <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> 's election <DATE>last week</DATE> and the meeting was supposed to focus on smoothing over the 030225 transfer of power between the outgoing and incoming leaders .
The 90 - minute talks instead centered on the North Korean government 's latest standoff with the international community .
President <PERSON>Kim</PERSON> 's spokeswoman Park Sun - sook said that <PERSON>Kim</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roh</PERSON> 's discussion was pinned down on international relations which focused on <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> 's nuclear issue .
The South Korean government 's frustration with the North Korean government was evident in a foreign ministry statement which urged the North Korean government to restore the seals and disabled monitoring cameras on the rods .
The statement said that the North Korean government took further actions to unfreeze its nuclear activities despite repeated warnings from the South Korean government and the international community and was raising regional tension and amplifying international concerns over nuclear proliferation .
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> responded to that development with swift condemnation .
<ORGANIZATION>US State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Louis Fintor</PERSON> said the over 8000 spent fuel rods are of particular concern because they can be reprocessed to recover plutonium for nuclear weapons .
US Senator <PERSON>Richard Lugar</PERSON> said the North Korean government was creating a very dangerous situation , initially for <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> and for <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> but ultimately for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .
Lugar will head the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Relations Committee</ORGANIZATION> in 030000 .
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has been stepping up international pressure on the North Korean government since 021222 .
Deputy US Ambassador <PERSON>Evans Revere</PERSON> met South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON>Lee Tai</PERSON> - sik in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> on 021223 to discuss countermeasures to be taken against the North Korean government following the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and South Korean foreign ministers ' urgent talks over the phone .
Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON>Yoriko Kawaguchi</PERSON> also expressed the widespread international alarm about the North Korean government 's regrettable latest move .
Analysts have said <LOCATION>North Koreans</LOCATION> could extract some 25 kilograms ( 55 pounds ) of weapons - grade plutonium for at least 3 nuclear weapons from the irradiated rods .
The North Korean government said it unfroze its nuclear facilities because it was in a desperate energy crisis aggravated by the suspension of fuel oil shipments .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government said the spent plutonium has nothing to do with power generation .
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> came close to war over the North Korean government 's plutonium program in the early <DATE>1990s</DATE> .
The confrontation was defused when the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and North Korean Governments signed the 940000 agreed framework .
That accord has been undermined since the North Korean government admitted in 021000 to running a new , secret and separate program based on enriched uranium .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government cut its fuel aid to the <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> in retaliation .

<LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> was criticized on <DATE>December 26 , 2002</DATE> for moving to restart its long - dormant nuclear program .
The UN atomic agency said such moves were tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship .
South Korean President <PERSON>Kim Dae Jung</PERSON> told officials that <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> 's shifting of unspent fuel rods into a building housing a reactor capable of producing weapons - grade plutonium aggravated an already - tense situation .
<PERSON>Kim Dae Jung</PERSON> and officials assembled at an urgent national security meeting .
<PERSON>Kim Dae Jung</PERSON> said that <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> moved to restart frozen nuclear facilities despite the international community 's efforts for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue .
This further aggravated the situation .
Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON>Junichiro Koizumi</PERSON> said the shift of the rods was proactive .
Plutonium could be extracted for making nuclear warheads within months .
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> dismissed the action as nuclear blackmail .
There was strong criticism from the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations ' International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> ) .
Beginning last week <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> saw its monitoring equipment disabled and seals removed from the nuclear facilities that had been dormant since a <DATE>1994</DATE> accord with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .
<ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> director <ORGANIZATION>Mohamed ElBaradei</ORGANIZATION> dismissed claims by <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> 's government that it was only acting in the wake of an energy crisis in <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> .
<PERSON>ElBaradei</PERSON> said that the reprocessing facility at <LOCATION>Yongbyong</LOCATION> is irrelevant to <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> 's ability to produce electricity .
<LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> has no current legitimate peaceful use for plutonium given the status of its nuclear fuel cycle .
<PERSON>ElBaradei</PERSON> said restarting <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> 's nuclear facilities without appropriate safeguards and towards producing plutonium raises serious non - proliferation concerns is tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship .
The move of 1,000 unspent rods into the reactor building is the latest action taken by the energy - starved North since the apparent collapse of a <DATE>1994</DATE> accord that froze its nuclear capacity .
The move is confirmed by both the UN agency and <ORGANIZATION>the South Korean Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> .
The facility has the capacity for 8,000 rods .
All have been stored in a cooling pond at <LOCATION>Yongbyon</LOCATION> since the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> offered <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> annual supplies of heavy fuel oil and two new light water nuclear reactors in return for <LOCATION>Pyongyang</LOCATION> 's agreement to freeze its nuclear operations at <LOCATION>Yongbyon</LOCATION> .
The eight - year - old deal has fallen apart following <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> revelations in <DATE>October 2002</DATE> that <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> had admitted to running a separate nuclear program based on enriched uranium technology in violation of the accord .
<LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> is bankrupt and on the brink of economic collapse .
It has been pushing for negotiations with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .
Experts say <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> needs aid and security guarantees from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to ensure its survival .
Throughout the nuclear dispute <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> has said it is ready to sit down and talk with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and even to refreeze its <LOCATION>Yongbyon</LOCATION> program .
President <PERSON>Kim</PERSON> has been pushing the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to accept the offer under <ORGANIZATION>Kim</ORGANIZATION> 's sunshine policy of engagement with the North .
President <PERSON>Kim</PERSON> has criticized the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for previously sidelining <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> in handling <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> and said <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> should take a leading role .
Kim was critical of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> handling of the stand - off when eight years ago the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> drew back from the brink of war over <LOCATION>Pyongyang</LOCATION> 's plutonium program .
The President has complained that <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> was sidelined during the entire dispute and ended up paying a multi - billion dollar bill for the light - water reactors .
Kim 's chief security adviser <PERSON>Yim Sung</PERSON> - <PERSON>joon</PERSON> said the President instructed that <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> should take lead because the North Korean nuclear issue is important to the <LOCATION>Korean peninsula</LOCATION> .
This was said in a statement after <DATE>December 26 , 2002</DATE> 's meeting .
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> said it would stand up to nuclear blackmail and has ruled out negotiations .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> pledged not to reward bad behavior .
Experts have joined the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> in dismissing the idea that <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> was relaunching the reactor for energy purposes .
Director <ORGANIZATION>General for International</ORGANIZATION> institutions at the ministry in <LOCATION>Seoul Chun Young</LOCATION> - Woo said it would produce at its peak enough for one large office building which is a negligible amount .

Experts warn that <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> could produce weapons - grade plutonium from spent fuel rods at re - opened nuclear reactor .
Existing rods could produce 3-6 atomic bombs in 6-8 months .
Experts stated that 8000 spent fuel rods reportedly stockpiled by <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> at a nuclear reactor the country is threatening to re - start could be used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons .
Experts stated that the rods could produce 3-6 atomic bombs in 6-8 months .
The <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> stated that <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> additionally moved 1000 fresh rods into the nuclear reactor as well .
The reactor could produce enough spent rods to construct 1 atomic bomb per year if reactivated .
The experimental nuclear plant in <LOCATION>Yongbyon</LOCATION> is a miniature of electricity - producing nuclear plants in Western countries but operates on the same principles .
The <LOCATION>Yongbyon</LOCATION> plant produces 5 megawatts .
Plants in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> produce 1300 megawatts .
The <LOCATION>Yongbyon</LOCATION> plant is 100 km north of the North Korean capital <LOCATION>Pyongyang</LOCATION> .
Nuclear reactor process --
4 meter fuel rods containing uranium oxide are burned to initiate fission -- the nucleus of the uranium atom is split , releasing neutrons that collide with other atoms , creating more neutrons in a chain reaction .
Fission produces immense heat which is applied to water to create steam which drives turbines to generate electricity .
Plutonium and other radioactive byproducts of the process accumulate and decrease the effectiveness of the rods until they are spent after 3-4 years .
Spent rods consisting of highly radioactive plutonium and residual uranium are cooled in pools of water for several years to diminish radioactivity and then the plutonium is then recovered in nitrate form and converted into oxide .
The recovered plutonium can be mixed with uranium for reuse in the reactor or used in making nuclear weapons .
Nuclear experts stated that to make weapons , a high proportion of plutonium 239 ( military grade plutonium , as opposed to the commercial plutonium used in power plants ) must be extracted .

Plutonium enough to produce 25 nuclear bombs which has gone unaccounted for at a Japanese nuclear facility is mostly due to measuring shortcomings and miscalculations .
A nuclear fuel reprocessing plant about 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) north of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Tokaimura</LOCATION> has extracted 6890 kilograms ( 15158 pounds or 7.6 short tons ) of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel since it began operating in 770000 .
A Japanese education and science ministry official said on 030128 that the total currently accounted for at the facility was 206 kg short of the plutonium initially estimated to have been produced by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel from power plants .
It is known to take 5-8 kg of plutonium to produce a nuclear bomb .
The official at the ministry 's nuclear safeguard office said that the case had been reported to the <ORGANIZATION>International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> ) of the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> .
The finding was also reported to the Japanese government 's <ORGANIZATION>Atomic Energy Commission</ORGANIZATION> on 030128 .
The education and <ORGANIZATION>scienc Ministry</ORGANIZATION> denied the possibility that any plutonium had been illegally removed from the facility .
The official said 94 kg of the missing plutonium is presumed to have dissolved into waste water without being measured .
The official added that another 29 kg disintegrated into another type of element .
The official said that plutonium may have been stuck to fuel tubes or mixed with waste water being processed to be solidified in glass and disposed of .
The official also pointed to possible errors in the estimate of plutonium extracted in the process .
The official said that there was a need for improvements in measuring and evaluating methods of plutonium .
The report was based on inspections at the <LOCATION>Tokaimura</LOCATION> facility done under <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> safeguard rules designed to prevent the transfer of nuclear materials for production of nuclear weapons .
<LOCATION>Tokaimura</LOCATION> is a <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Coast</ORGANIZATION> complex of nuclear - related facilities and made headlines in 990000 when the world 's worst nuclear plant accident since Chernobyl in 860000 occurred at a uranium reprocessing plant there .
3 workers set off a critical reaction in 990000 when they poured too much uranium into a precipitation tank .
2 of the 3 workers later died .
Safety concerns at nuclear facilities in <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> were further highlighted on 030127 when a <ORGANIZATION>High Court</ORGANIZATION> upheld the suspension of operations of a troubled experimental fast - breeder reactor which has been shut since an accident in 950000 .

Indonesian authorities stated that the Islamic militant group <LOCATION>Jemaah Islamiyah</LOCATION> is responsible .
The attack is considered part of a global incitement to Jihad by al-Qaeda and its allies .
Advani stated --
The <LOCATION>Bali</LOCATION> attack established <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> as a potential new theater for the spread of jihadi extremism .
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> previously knew that the operational center of jihadi terrorism is located near <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> due to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> - lead bombing campaign against extremist bases in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> .
Advani stated --
The menace of religious extremism has inspired international terrorism .
Terrorism should not be identified with any religion but jihadi terrorism has spread more global violence than any other extremist doctrine .
Advani stated --
Countries must continue in pursuing enhanced cooperation including intelligence sharing and border controls to combat the problem perpetrated by global terrorism and its concomitants -- drug trafficking , illegal arms trade and cross - border crime .
While the international consensus is that terrorism cannot be tolerated , the instruments the international community proposes to deal with terrorism do not meet the requirements of the problem .
Advani stated at a forum organized by the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Southeast Asian Studies</ORGANIZATION> --
Countries must formulate and implement an integrated and cooperative approach to security by designing new security systems to protecting transport , communication and energy infrastructure from terrorist attack as well as obstructing terrorists ' funding .
Unilateral military action such as the standoff between the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> on disarming Iraqi President <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON> threatens peace and could lead to unforeseen negative consequences .

Kashmiri militant groups claim responsibility for attack on Indian police post in the disputed region that killed at least 11 people .
Indian officials claim that foreign infiltrators from <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> executed the attack but local Kashmiri groups call this baseless propaganda .
On 16 <DATE>March 2003</DATE> Kashmiri militants claimed responsibility for an attack on a police post in the disputed state of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> stating that they attacked to avenge the killing of their commanders by Indian troops .
The <ORGANIZATION>Hizbul Mujahideen</ORGANIZATION> is the largest group fighting Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan region .
A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION>Hizbul Mujahideen</ORGANIZATION> who declined to be identified stated to AFP --
The attack was in retaliation to the recent killing of district commander <PERSON>Amanullah</PERSON> and 3 other fighters of <ORGANIZATION>Hizbul Mujahideen</ORGANIZATION> by the Indian army in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> .
Approximately 10 to 15 fighters from <ORGANIZATION>Hizbul Mujahideen</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Harkatul Mujahideen</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>Harkatul Jihad</LOCATION> - e - Islami and <PERSON>Al Badar</PERSON> attacked the camp before <TIME>midnight</TIME> on 15 <DATE>March 2003</DATE> and into 16 <DATE>March 2003</DATE> and killed at least 12 soldiers .
All the fighters who participated in the operation were local Kashmiris not infiltrators from <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> as claimed by Indian officials .
The Indian claim that cross - border incursions have increased is baseless and aimed at covering up its failures in occupied <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> .
The militants attacked the post in Gool in the <LOCATION>Udhampur</LOCATION> district approximately 95 miles north of <LOCATION>Indian Kashmir</LOCATION> 's winter capital <LOCATION>Jammu</LOCATION> .
At least 11 people were killed in the attack .
A spokesman for another Kashmiri separatist group called <ORGANIZATION>Harkatul Mujahideen</ORGANIZATION> agreed with the Hizbul official stating --
The attack was executed by local Kashmiri fighters affiliated with 4 groups .
If <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> blames foreign militants it is part of its propaganda to mislead the international community .
The <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> region is divided between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and is claimed by both .
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> have fought 2 wars over <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> since each gained independence from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in <DATE>1947</DATE> .

<LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION> increased its air defenses to prevent any missiles fired during the <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> war from threatening its Caspian coast .
The coast is a home to vital oil industry installation .
On <DATE>March 21 , 2003</DATE> a spokesman for the Central Asian country 's defense ministry said <LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION> increased its air defenses to prevent any missiles fired during the <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> war from threatening its Caspian coast .
The coast is a home to vital oil industry installation .
Defense ministry spokesman abish smailov told AFP that incidents occur when powerful weapons such as Scud missiles are used .
Smailov said that Kazakh air space is controlled at all times using measures involving anti - missile defenses , fighter jets and anti - terrorist units .
<LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION> 's increased air defenses come during <LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION> 's air force carries out exercises along its Caspian shores .
The shores are a center of <LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION> 's nascent oil industry .
Western countries said it is inadequately defended in the event of terrorist attack .
Ex - <LOCATION>Soviet Kazakhstan</LOCATION> is separated from <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> by a 600 - kilometer ( 360 - mile ) section of the Caspian Sea and Iranian territory .

Several million Thai people use the drug .
The methamphetamine pills known as <ORGANIZATION>Yaa BAA</ORGANIZATION> have surpassed heroin as <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> 's number one killer drug .
Several million Thai people use the drug .
The pill has become part of Thai society .
No other drug has become as integral in decades .
The effects on the brains of its consumers is disastrous .
Yaa <ORGANIZATION>BAA</ORGANIZATION> is known as crazy medicine in <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> .
It has been targeted in a two - month anti - drugs crackdown that has resulted in the deaths of nearly 1,900 suspected traffickers .
There is much concern over the drug .
The drug 's popularity increased in the mid - <DATE>1990s</DATE> .
It has made <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> the world 's number one consumer .
<PERSON>Pierre</PERSON> - <ORGANIZATION>Arnaud chouvy</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Joel meissonnier</PERSON> state in their book Yaa <ORGANIZATION>BAA</ORGANIZATION> recently published by the <ORGANIZATION>Institute of Research</ORGANIZATION> on contemporary <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> that the psychotropic drugs is used across society for both work and pleasure .
Construction workers , sailors , farmers and taxi drivers take the drug to help them through long working days .
Students use it to get through exam periods .
Clubbers use it to help them dance all night .
Yaa <ORGANIZATION>BAA</ORGANIZATION> possesses several qualities that have helped it supplant heroin as the drug of choice in <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> .
The book states that the drug conveys a completely positive image .
It appears modern and inoffensive because it is synthetic .
The energy , confidence and euphoric feeling has given users an image as a drug of happiness .
The pills can also be easily consumed .
They can be popped or dissolved in a glass of water , taken intravenously , pulverized and inhaled , or smoked .
There are at least 90 types of the pill .
Yaa <ORGANIZATION>BAA</ORGANIZATION> is easy to manufacture and do not have any climate uncertainties like other drugs have .
Instructions on how to manufacture the drug are available on the Internet .
Heroin requires opium poppy as its raw ingredient and cocaine depends on yields from the coca plant .
The drug has an affordable price .
It cost <MONEY>60 baht</MONEY> ( <MONEY>1.50 dollars</MONEY> ) per pill on the streets before <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> 's drug war started on <DATE>February 1 , 2003</DATE> and push the price up 300 percent .
The pill costs five <MONEY>- cents</MONEY> to produce .
800 million pills entered <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Myanmar</LOCATION> last year .
The book states that the majority of the drug comes from <LOCATION>Myanmar</LOCATION> particularly the areas controlled by the Wa of the <ORGANIZATION>UWSA</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>United Wa State Army</ORGANIZATION> ) .
The book is referring to the pro - <LOCATION>Yangon</LOCATION> ethnic group said to operate around 50 laboratories close to the border and the mobile production units .
Myanmar could become an unrivaled regional producer because of the links between the military rulers and the <ORGANIZATION>UWSA</ORGANIZATION> , and the jungle canopy where <ORGANIZATION>UWSA</ORGANIZATION> operate .
The military and <ORGANIZATION>UWSA</ORGANIZATION> links result in a lack of law enforcement .
The drug has become a specialty of the Golden Triangle where <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Myanmar</LOCATION> converge .
Much of the world 's opium is still produced there .
Chouvy and meissonnier say that methamphetamine is overtaking heroin as the production drug of choice in the area and is profiting enormously from the distribution networks that heroin trafficking has already established .
<PERCENT>Five percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> 's population is now estimated to abuse methamphetamine .
The <ORGANIZATION>International Narcotics Control Bureau</ORGANIZATION> says the figure makes it the largest per capita consumer in the world .
The drug has been around in other forms for years .
It was first used in the <DATE>1920s</DATE> as an antidepressant and then as a psychostimulant during World War II and the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War .
People recruited from impoverished ethnic minorities transport the pills along a multitude of routes .
Myanmar soldiers and Thai police and bureaucrats protect the cargo and allow them to eventually reach consumers in <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> .
The books states that one pill will pass through seven intermediaries from the frontier runner to the retailer .
The retailer will usually sell more to the drug user than he or she requires .
This creates another dealer and explains the drug 's easy availability across <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> .
Owners of boats in the southern coastal province of <LOCATION>Ranong</LOCATION> and construction foremen in <LOCATION>Bangkok</LOCATION> are known to force their workers to take the drug at the beginning of the workday .
Occasionally in rural areas the farmers dissolve the drug in a bottle which they drink while working .
Consumers are as young as seven and school has become one of the main hubs for trafficking of methamphetamine .
<LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> 's youth are the most at risk .

The traditional fighting season in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> is spring after the harsh winters .

On 02 <DATE>April 2003</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> stated that security in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> was volatile and unpredictable following a series of attacks against foreigners .
In a travel advisory the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> stated that travel in all areas of <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> including the capital <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION> is unsafe due to military operations , land mines , banditry , armed rivalry among political and tribal groups , and the possibility of terrorist attacks including attacks using vehicular or other bombs .
Taliban and al-Qaeda militants regularly launch attacks on government and foreign targets .
Last week a foreign <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> worker was murdered and 2 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> special forces were killed in an ambush while on patrol .

Jalali stated --
Approximately 15 suspected Taliban members were captured in <LOCATION>Kandahar</LOCATION> and 9 killed in operations launched after the 27 <DATE>March 2003</DATE> murder of the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> worker .
Most of the terrorist attacks are carried out by former <ORGANIZATION>Taliban</ORGANIZATION> members based across the border in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> .
These members have confessed that they were sent from <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> into <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> by the former Taliban leader .
The <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> - based former Taliban members conducting the attacks were being funded by former drug smuggling operations or by supporters in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> .
The militants coming across the border from <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> into <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> are organized by former <ORGANIZATION>Taliban</ORGANIZATION> elements .
Funds are transferred to the <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> - based former <ORGANIZATION>Taliban</ORGANIZATION> members from <LOCATION>Karachi</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Quetta</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Peshawar</LOCATION> but this does not indicate that the Government of <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> is supporting the former <ORGANIZATION>Taliban</ORGANIZATION> .
It is true that the interrogated Afghan Taliban stated that they had come from <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and received their financial support from <LOCATION>Karachi</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Quetta</LOCATION> but this does not indicate that the Government of <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> is supporting them .

A purported Ayman al-Zawahiri recording called for more suicide attacks , highlighting again the role of Egyptians in al-Qaeda , while suspicions grow that another Egyptian , <PERSON>Seif al-Adel</PERSON> , may have been behind the bombings in <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> .
In a message aired 030521 by Arabic <LOCATION>Qatar</LOCATION> 's Al-Jazeera satellite channel , the purported voice of Ayman al-Zawahiri urged Muslims to force Westerners out of Muslim lands by attacking westerners and emulating the 010911 suicide attacks in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .
The speaker called for Muslims to muster their resolve and hit the embassies of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> , and strike at the interests , companies and employees of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> .
The speaker urged Muslims to attack and eject Americans , British , Australians and Norwegians out of Muslim homelands .
The speaker told Muslims not to allow Americans , British , Australians , Norwegians or other Western Christians to live in and benefit from the resources of Muslim countries .
Egyptian experts said this audiotape was a genuine recording of <PERSON>Zawahiri</PERSON> 's voice and proved <PERSON>Zawahiri</PERSON> was alive and still as influential as before in al-Qaeda .
Montasser al-Zayat , a lawyer who has represented Islamic militant suspects in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> , stated he was certain that the voice on the tape was that of Zawahiri , Al-Qaeda leader <LOCATION>Osama</LOCATION> bin <ORGANIZATION>Laden</ORGANIZATION> 's top lieutenant .
Al-Zayat stated that the recording was <PERSON>Zawahiri</PERSON> 's voice , style and manner .
Dia al-Rashwan stated that he believed that the voice was <PERSON>Zawahiri</PERSON> 's and that the message bore <PERSON>Zawahiri</PERSON> 's characteristic emphasis on Islamic militant attacks against Arab governments which are allied to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .
Al-Rashwan is a journalist with <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> 's government daily Al-Ahram and an expert on Islamic militants .
According to <PERSON>Rashwan</PERSON> , while bin Laden has always stressed international targets , <PERSON>Zawahiri</PERSON> has gradually shown increasing support for Arab targets as well .
Rashwan thought it was clear that <PERSON>Zawahiri</PERSON> is still second in command of al-Qaeda and that his stress on local ( Arab ) targets was influencing not only statements and actions by Al-Qaeda itself but also groups inspired by them .
Montasser al-Zayat said that he believed bin Laden was under secure protection with <PERSON>Zawahiri</PERSON> .
Zayat thought that security conditions sometimes dictate which one speaks out .
The situations and locations of <LOCATION>Zawahiri</LOCATION> , bin Laden and other top al-Qaeda members have been unknown since the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> struck the bases of al-Qaeda and its Taliban supporters in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> in 011000 .
Rashwan was unable to illuminate suspicions that <PERSON>Seif al-Adel</PERSON> , another Egyptian , might have masterminded the triple suicide bombings that killed 34 people , including 9 bombers , in <LOCATION>Riyadh</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Suadi Arabia</LOCATION> 030512 .
Rashwan and other Egyptian experts said that Adel has become Al-Qaeda 's number 3 in command since becoming chief of military operations and succeeding <PERSON>Abu Hafs al-Masri</PERSON> .
Al-Masri was killed during the war in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> .
Adel was a top member in the Egyptian Islamic militant movement Al - <LOCATION>Jihad</LOCATION> .
Al-Jihad was led by <PERSON>Zawahiri</PERSON> and carried out many attacks in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1990s</DATE> .
Adel left <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> at the end of the <DATE>1980s</DATE> for a <ORGANIZATION>Gulf Arab</ORGANIZATION> country , then traveled to <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and then <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> , where he helped train militants at some camps , Egyptian sources said on condition they not be named .
The Egyptian sources also said that <ORGANIZATION>Adel</ORGANIZATION> is close to both <PERSON>Zawahiri</PERSON> and bin Laden .
A senior Saudi official said 030519 that he believed Adel directed the bombings in <LOCATION>Riyadh</LOCATION> .
A senior <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> official stated that it was still not clear whether Adel had personally been involved .
Like Zawahiri , <PERSON>Adel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Al-Masri</PERSON> were on a list of 12 most wanted suspects released by the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> administration following the 010911 attacks .
At least three other Egyptians were also on the list : <PERSON>Tharwat Salah Shehata</PERSON> , Tariq Anwar As - <PERSON>Sayyid Ahmad</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mohammad Salah</PERSON> .
Egyptian security sources said that <LOCATION>Ahmad</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Salah</PERSON> were killed in the war on terror launched after 010911 .
Ahmad and Salah were believed to have organized suicide attacks .
Shehata , a laywer , is considered by security sources in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> to be responsible for Al-Qaeda 's funding .

Troops are facing angry farmers unaware that poppy cultivation is now punishable as a drug trafficking offense .
Indian troops already fighting rebels are now also engaged in a massive operation to destroy poppy crops in <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> .
Customs officials from the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Finance Ministry</ORGANIZATION> launched the campaign with security forces on 15 <DATE>May 2003</DATE> in the southern <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> already affected by much violence .
The campaign requires troops to confront angry residents desperate to earn a living and unaware they are violating the law .
Senior Customs Officer V. Prabhakar stated that in <DATE>2003</DATE> the troops have destroyed opium poppy crops dispersed over 224.73 hectares ( 556 acres ) in 27 villages of <LOCATION>Anantnag</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pulwama</LOCATION> districts .
A similar drive was carried out in <DATE>2002</DATE> in the same region but did not stop residents from replanting .
Prabhakar stated --
The crop destruction of <DATE>2002</DATE> has not served as a deterrent .
The <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> administration has been lax on the issue .
No district official has ever taken steps to destroy the crop nor even reported that poppy crops are grown in his area .
Villagers in this region approximately 30 kilometers ( 18 miles ) south of <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> 's <DATE>summer</DATE> capital <LOCATION>Srinagar</LOCATION> stated that cultivating poppy crops was their only livelihood .
Farmer Ghulam Ahmed stated that he and other farmers have been growing poppy crops in their fields for years with no objection from anyone .
Ahmed stated that residents were shocked when officials and troops started destroying their harvest .
Many villagers grow poppy for their seeds used to flavor the Kashmiri bread known as kulcha .
Kulcha is always in great demand across the Himalayan region .
Bakers buy the seeds at <MONEY>100 rupees</MONEY> ( two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollars ) per kilogram .
The lucrative byproduct is poppy <ORGANIZATION>SAP</ORGANIZATION> which can be processed into opium .
Rahti Begum was disconsolate as she watched her crop being destroyed .
Begum who raises the 3 children of her late son stated that her poppy crop is her only source of income .
Some officials admit the residents are not at fault .
A <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> official told <ORGANIZATION>AFP</ORGANIZATION> --
These villagers are innocent .
They cultivate the crop for poppy seeds unaware that its cultivation is punishable .
The villagers are inadvertently involving themselves in drug trafficking .
Officials state that because many farmers are unaware of these laws security forces make no arrests over poppy cultivation .
Prabhakar states --
If the cultivation continues unrestrained <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> may soon become notorious for narcotics .
This has potential serious consequences as Kashmiri youth may become addicted to narcotics grown in the region .
Poppy cultivation at present is largely organized by groups who use their own trucks to transport the drugs for sale in other parts of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> .
In <DATE>2002</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Indian army</ORGANIZATION> seized 350 kilograms ( 772 pounds ) of narcotics in the <LOCATION>Kashmir Valley</LOCATION> .
He will intensify the anti - drug operation .

The Chinese government 's recent conclusion that <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> has enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb has resulted in urgent diplomacy and plans for new talks .
Chinese deputy foreign minister was dispatched to <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> to meet with <PERSON>Kim Jong</PERSON> - Il in an attempt to deescalate the situation .
Chinese diplomats were quoted in the Asian Wall Street Journal on 18 <DATE>July 2003</DATE> as stating that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> believes <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> currently has enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb .
This belief caused the <ORGANIZATION>Government of China</ORGANIZATION> to accelerate diplomacy to resolve the crisis and to dispatch Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON>Dai Bingguo</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Pyongyang</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> on 12 <DATE>July 2003</DATE> in this effort .
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> 's closest ally .
<LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> is a Stalinist regime .
Dai is presently in <LOCATION>Washington D.C.</LOCATION> to inform top <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> policymakers of the outcome of the rare meeting with North Korean leader <PERSON>Kim Jong</PERSON> - Il .
The newspaper stated that in recent weeks Chinese intelligence services concluded that <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> is producing weapons - grade plutonium in sufficient quantities and possesses all the necessary components to assemble nuclear - tipped missiles .
A European official familiar with internal Chinese reports on the findings and Chinese diplomats were quoted in the newspaper as stating that the reprocessed plutonium is estimated to be sufficient to make at least 1 nuclear device .
The European official stated that <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> has yet to combine the plutonium , triggering devices and other components into a bomb .
The Chinese reports in part verify recent claims made by the Government of <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> that a number of spent nuclear fuel rods sealed in <DATE>1994</DATE> have been opened and have undergone reprocessing ostensibly to produce plutonium .
Until now <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> had stated that no evidence existed that <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> was seeking nuclear weapons .
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government has been unable to confirm the North Korean government 's claims .
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and South Korean officials have speculated that <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> may have 1 or 2 nuclear bombs and may have the capacity to build 6 .
The Chinese government 's increasing concern was made evident by the new urgency of its diplomacy this week .
At a foreign ministry briefing on 17 <DATE>July 2003</DATE> spokesman <PERSON>Kong Quan</PERSON> stated that the North Korean crisis was at a critical point .
Kong Quan stated that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is attempting to deescalate the situation by promoting talks and encouraging the 2 parties to make peace .
Kong Quan stated that it is important that the parties return to negotiations and continue with the trilateral talks that commenced in <DATE>April 2003</DATE> .
The trilateral talks of <DATE>April</DATE> ended poorly with the North Korean government stating it possessed and might test nuclear weapons .
According to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials there is now a greater possibility that new talks could occur as <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> appears willing to join another negotiating session with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .
There were also indications that the dialogue could be expanded to include <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> .
South Korean officials have been quoted as saying that a dialogue could take place as early as <DATE>August 2003</DATE> .
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> government has always insisted on multilateral talks and has been eager to include its Japanese and South Korean allies .
<LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> has consistently demanded 1 - on - 1 talks with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government .
The Government of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> emphasizes that it is more important to resume talks quickly than to refrain until the number of participants can be agreed upon .
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is a traditional ally and supplier of food and fuel to <LOCATION>North Korea China</LOCATION> and is therefore the country with the most leverage over <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> .
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has demonstrated that it is willing to take advantage of this leverage .
Earlier in the crisis <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> stopped oil supplies to <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> for several days .
2 days after North Korean leader <PERSON>Kim Jong</PERSON> - Il granted Dai the rare meeting for 14 <DATE>July 2003</DATE> the regime 's <ORGANIZATION>Korean Central News Agency</ORGANIZATION> announced that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> had recently decided to donate 10000 tons of diesel oil to <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> .

La times probe finds strong evidence that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> appears to be in the late stages of developing the capacity to build a nuclear bomb .
The <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Times</ORGANIZATION> in the 030804 edition Summarized results of an independent probe which strongly indicated that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> is striving to become the world 's next nuclear power and appears to be in the late stages of developing the capacity to build a nuclear bomb .
The <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Times</ORGANIZATION> said the 3 - month investigation drew on previously secret reports , international officials , independent experts , Iranian exiles and intelligence sources and uncovered strong evidence that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's commercial program masked a military undertaking .
The Times report said that scientists from <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> plus advancing technology have propelled <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear program much closer to producing a bomb than <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> ever was .
The Times pointed out that some experts predict <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> might produce an initial atomic weapon in the next 2-3 years .
No one is certain about the actual time frame for <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear weapon production .
Nuclear materials :
The Times said a confidential report prepared by the French Government in 030500 concluded that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> is surprisingly close to having enriched uranium or plutonium for a bomb .
A foreign intelligence service provided a copy of the report to the times .
The French government warned other governments in the report to exercise the most serious vigilance on their exports to <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and Iranian front companies .
The Times report said that samples of uranium taken by UN inspectors in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> in 030600 tested positive for enrichment levels high enough to be consistent with an attempt to build a nuclear weapon .
The Iranian government also secretly imported 1.8 tons of nuclear material from <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in 910000 and processed some of this nuclear material in order to manufacture uranium metal .
This uranium would be of no use in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's commercial program but would be integral to weapons production .
foreign scientists ' involvement :
The Times quoted an <ORGANIZATION>unnamed Middle Eastern</ORGANIZATION> intelligence official that <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> 's role was bigger than thought from the beginning .
<PERSON>Abdul Qadeer Khan</PERSON> has helped <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> for years and is a Pakistani nuclear scientist regarded by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> as a purveyor of nuclear secrets .
The Times said people inside <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and foreign intelligence officials say that North Korean military scientists had been recently monitored entering Iranian nuclear facilities and are assisting in the design of a nuclear warhead .
There is a resort on the Caspian coast set aside for the exclusive use of <LOCATION>North Koreans</LOCATION> who are working on nuclear and missile projects in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> .
This indicates the number of <LOCATION>North Koreans</LOCATION> working in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> on such projects .
Russian scientists sometimes travel to <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> under false identities and work without the Russian government 's approval to help complete a special reactor that could produce weapons - grade plutonium .
New technology :
The report said Iranians have also approached European companies in recent months to buy devices that can manipulate large volumes of radioactive material .
This technology is for forging uranium metal and plutonium and switches that could trigger a nuclear weapon .
European intelligence sources said list of items the Iranians have wished to procure was a strong indication that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> has moved to the late stages of weapons development .

Live poultry smuggling undermines WHO and <ORGANIZATION>FAO</ORGANIZATION> efforts to restrict bird flu spread in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> .
<ORGANIZATION>FAO</ORGANIZATION> and WHO advise countries to tighten border security .
Smugglers are undermining international efforts headed by the <ORGANIZATION>UN World Health Organization</ORGANIZATION> ( WHO ) and <ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Organization</ORGANIZATION> ( FAO ) to eradicate bird flu by trafficking illegal live poultry that threaten to spread the disease to new areas .
Attempts to halt bird flu spread --
Agriculture and customs officials have increased border checks throughout the affected region to halt illicit trade .
Recent arrests of live poultry smugglers have occurred at checkpoints .
Most affected Asian countries have banned the import and export of live and slaughtered poultry to prevent the movement of potentially infected chickens and ducks across borders .
Senior <ORGANIZATION>FAO Animal Production and Health Officer</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> <PERSON>Hans Wagner</PERSON> stated --
The <ORGANIZATION>FAO</ORGANIZATION> is concerned and well aware that there is copious uncontrolled movement of animals between borders in some Asian countries .
Smuggling occurs chiefly across the Green or uncontrolled borders of <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Myanmar</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is likely a source for spreading the flu and other diseases .
Authorities in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> stated that smuggling of meat and fruit from <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has increased drastically in the past year .
<LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> has experienced 9 flu fatalities and is the country worst affected by the disease .
Preventing smuggling from <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> is difficult because the country 's extensive land borders with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> are poorly controlled by a notoriously corrupt customs department .
Most nations have tightened border controls in accordance with <ORGANIZATION>FAO</ORGANIZATION> and WHO advisories .
20040120 Cambodian authorities detained 10 in the southern province of Ta KEO for importing over 150000 duck eggs from <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> .
<LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> has continuously been combating chicken and egg smuggling from <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> and is on high alert .
20040202 <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> tightened security against smugglers following the discovery in 20031200 of H 5N1 in ducks smuggled from mainland <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .
<LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> has previously successfully controlled an outbreak of the milder H 5N2 flu strain .
Taiwanese coastguards increased patrols around the island and several island groups off the Chinese mainland .
Approximately 8000 poultry and pig farmers were vaccinated against human flu to prevent it mutating with bird flu strains .
<LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is free of the disease but has deployed hundreds of soldiers to the border with <LOCATION>Myanmar</LOCATION> .
Myanmar has no reported H 5N1 cases but Indian officials suspect that poultry could be smuggled through <LOCATION>Myanmar</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> .
<LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> is one of the countries worst affected by the virus .
<LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> authorities have increased security along the border with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .

Discontinuing these technology transfers would cause several millions of yuan 's of losses to <ORGANIZATION>SAIC</ORGANIZATION> .
The <ORGANIZATION>China Business Post</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>SAIC</ORGANIZATION> had invested large sums in the scheduled acquisition of the Platform , including acquiring an auto manufacturing plant in <ORGANIZATION>Yizheng</ORGANIZATION> city in eastern <LOCATION>Jiangsu</LOCATION> province .
The reported plan was for <ORGANIZATION>SAIC</ORGANIZATION> to produce a new sedan model designed on the Santana platform and with the car set to be launched in 040500 .
The <ORGANIZATION>China Business Post</ORGANIZATION> said the termination was due in part to <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION> 's adjustment of strategies regarding <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and to ineffective communication with <ORGANIZATION>Volkswagen</ORGANIZATION> 's Chinese partners .

French anti - terrorist judge calls terrorism serious threat despite dispersal and weakening of al-Qaeda .
Restraining extremist groups is becoming increasingly difficult because of how the groups are financed .
<LOCATION>France</LOCATION> 's top anti - terrorist judge Jean - <PERSON>Louis Bruguiere</PERSON> stated to AFP 29 <DATE>February 2004</DATE> that al-Qaeda is still capable of inspiring people to carry out attacks despite being much weaker since the 11 <DATE>September 2001</DATE> attacks and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> - led war in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> .
Bruguiere has led the French legal effort against extremism and terrorism in recent years .
Bruguiere stated --
The global fight against terrorism is against an increasingly elusive enemy with access to funds virtually impossible to control .
The threat comes from long - standing members of al-Qaeda .
Al-Qaeda is an organization which still exists but has been significantly weakened by the neutralization and capture of a number of its members and of those in charge .
In an interview in <ORGANIZATION>Monaco Bruguiere</ORGANIZATION> called global terrorism a scattered and polymorphous threat .
Bruguiere was in <LOCATION>Monaco</LOCATION> attending a meeting of the international organization involved in <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> political studies called club of <ORGANIZATION>Monaco</ORGANIZATION> .
Dozens of alleged members of al-Qaeda have been captured or killed since the group claimed responsibility for the 11 <DATE>September</DATE> attacks on <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington D.C.</LOCATION> but authorities have not been able to locate al-Qaeda 's leader <LOCATION>Osama</LOCATION> bin Laden or his top deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri .
On 24 <DATE>February 2004</DATE> Zawahiri appeared in 2 taped messages broadcast by the Arab - language Al-Arabiya and Al-Jazeera television stations calling in remarks attributed to him for renewed attacks on the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .
Bruguiere stated --
Restraining extremist groups particularly across <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> was becoming increasingly difficult because of how the groups are financed .
The networks operating in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> benefit from micro - financing and not from macro - financing .
Fraudulent charge cards could be used to withdraw significant sums which are then distributed through micro - channels outside the classic financial circles and are practically impossible to detect .
Use of false credit cards is growing .
It is necessary to expand existing laws to combat the funding mechanisms .
All existing legal or institutional measures are insufficient to neutralize this threat .
Al-Qaeda is only 1 of many worldwide threats among the many radical Islamic organizations involved in an international jihad and sharing the al-Qaeda strategy that are pursuing regional options .
The groups are particularly active in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> .
Bruguiere made these comments before going into a meeting with approximately 40 high - ranking or former top international officials .
Since the <DATE>September 2001</DATE> strikes on the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> deadly large - scale attacks have occurred in other parts of the world .
Among the targets have been a synagogue in northern <LOCATION>Tunisia</LOCATION> , a nightclub in <LOCATION>Bali</LOCATION> , a hotel in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> and numerous locations in <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> .
Analysts have warned that <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> could become a breeding ground for terrorist organizations if a political solution is not found soon .

<ORGANIZATION>Amnesty International</ORGANIZATION> urges <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> to treat surrendered ethnic Hmong rebels humanely while Lao officials claim there are no rebels and no insurgency .
The rights group states that Lao troops promised rebels amnesty and a living area if they surrender but has received conflicting reports as to whether the <ORGANIZATION>Lao Government</ORGANIZATION> has upheld this agreement .
On 05 <DATE>March 2004</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Amnesty International</ORGANIZATION> called on the Lao Government to ensure that 100s of ethnic Hmong anti - government insurgents and their families who had reportedly surrendered were treated humanely .
From its <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> headquarters <ORGANIZATION>Amnesty International</ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying that the Lao People 's Democratic Republic has international obligations in this regard under the <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> Conventions and the 2 UN covenants .
On 03 <DATE>March 2004</DATE> the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government - funded network <ORGANIZATION>Radio Free Asia</ORGANIZATION> reported --
Up to 700 insurgents and their relatives and 8 rebel commanders surrendered after government troops surrounded several northern holdouts in late <DATE>February 2004</DATE> .
Troops used leaflets and megaphones to help communicate to the rebels that authorities would grant them amnesty and a special living area if they surrendered .
Approximately 300 people surrendered near <LOCATION>Luang Prabang</LOCATION> after traveling on foot from farther north and between 300 and 400 people surrendered in Xieng Khouang province .
Amnesty International stated it had received conflicting reports as to their reception and treatment by the authorities .
Lao <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Ministry Spokesman Yong Chanthalangsy</ORGANIZATION> denied that anyone had surrendered insisting also that there were no rebels in the impoverished communist nation .
Yong Chanthalangsy told AFP that no one surrendered , that there are no rebels and there is no war in <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> .
Yong Chanthalangsy stated that there are many people coming out of the forests to take advantage of Lao poverty eradication programs .
Following a series of deadly highway ambushes and bomb blasts the Lao Government called in <DATE>August 2003</DATE> on Hmong and others whom they called ethnic minority bandits to lay down their arms , to come out from the forest and to rejoin society .
The <ORGANIZATION>Lao Government</ORGANIZATION> warned that failure to do so would result in heavy consequences .
Small bands of ethnic minority rebels predominantly Hmong remain from the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> - sponsored guerrilla army mobilized to wage the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> ' secret campaign in <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> during the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War .
Some 300000 Hmong fled to <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> after the Communist takeover in <LOCATION>Laos</LOCATION> in <DATE>1975</DATE> but the remaining rebels have continued a low - level , ineffective insurgency for nearly three decades .
The Lao military has been accused by human rights groups of using harsh and often brutal tactics to eliminate them .
Amnesty International called on the Lao Government to provide UN agencies and other non - governmental organizations access to all those who have put down their arms in order to assist with basic humanitarian needs .
Amnesty International stated --
Longer term assistance with their reintegration into Lao society will also be needed .
It is essential that neutral observers are given access to these groups of former rebels in order to independently assess their situation and the veracity of ongoing claims of serious human rights violations being made by overseas ethnic Hmong groups .
The Lao Government should seize this opportunity to find a peaceful solution to decades of fighting and the high human cost on all sides of the conflict .
In <DATE>January 2004</DATE> , <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> - based Lao exiles warned that Lao forces had launched a new offensive against 1000s of Hmong rebels and civilians and accused the communist regime of using starvation as a weapon of war .

Desiring admission into the <LOCATION>European Union</LOCATION> , Albanian government increased efforts against drug trafficking by strengthening laws , seizing illegal drugs , and investigating possibly corrupt police officials .
Under the pressure of the <ORGANIZATION>European Union the Albanian Government</ORGANIZATION> has escalated its fight against drug trafficking by preparing a new strategy to halt the smuggling of hashish and heroin over Albanian territory from <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> towards the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> .
A recent <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> report on <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> stated the situation in <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> , which has remained an important country for the traffic of narcotics , is worrisome .
The report suggested the <LOCATION>Tirana</LOCATION> government adopt an efficient strategy in the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> 's efforts against drug trafficking .
Albanian interior minister <LOCATION>Igli Toska</LOCATION> stated --
The fight against drug trafficking will be the Albanian government 's main challenge in <DATE>2004</DATE> .
The <ORGANIZATION>Albanian Government</ORGANIZATION> has been working on a project of national strategy which will require international support and cooperation .
<LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> 's geographic position , <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> 's trade with <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Greece</LOCATION> , and the situation after the <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION> war are all elements Albanian criminal groups profit from , thereby making <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> an important stop for the transit of narcotics .
In <DATE>July 2004</DATE> the Albanian government plans to present a set of anti - Mafia laws which will allow confiscation of property belonging to persons involved in criminal and illegal activities .
Albanian justice minister <PERSON>Adrian dvorani</PERSON> stated the anti - Mafia laws also provide for the special protection of witnesses or people involved in illegal trafficking who decide to testify and will enable a more efficient strategy .
Albanian officials aspire to <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> membership .
The Albanian government has made a significant development in the government 's fight against drug smugglers in <DATE>2004</DATE> .
In <DATE>2003</DATE> Albanian police infiltrated an international drug network operating between <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Macedonia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> and controlled by the <PERSON>Kosovo Albanian</PERSON> and Turkish criminal groups linked with the <ORGANIZATION>Calabrian Mafia organization N'Drangheta</ORGANIZATION> .
In <DATE>May 2004</DATE> approximately 100 policemen -- 25 of them in top positions -- were dismissed on suspected ties with organized crime .
60 others have been investigated on similar charges .
Toska stated there will be no smugglers without corrupted policemen and <LOCATION>Toska</LOCATION> announced tougher measures against policemen and security officials linked with criminal groups .
The <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> report quotes the names of several Albanian politicians directly or indirectly involved in drugs trafficking but no measures have so far been taken against the politicians .
Albanian police forces have seized more than 200 kilos ( 440 pounds ) of heroin and around 8 tons of cannabis between <DATE>November 2003</DATE> and <DATE>May 2004</DATE> , double that which was seized in <DATE>2003</DATE> .
Experts say the figures of drugs seized are insignificant compared to the estimated quantities of narcotics that are smuggled through <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> .
International Police experts based in <LOCATION>Tirana</LOCATION> estimate the value of the narcotics in transit at over <MONEY>2 billion dollars</MONEY> ( about <MONEY>1.6 billion euros</MONEY> ) per year .
Experts estimate the amount smuggled through <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> makes up approximately 25 to <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of the narcotics smuggled into the European market from the <LOCATION>Balkans</LOCATION> .
Albanian police official <PERSON>Xhavit Shala</PERSON> stated Albanian smugglers are linked to the international criminal organizations like ( the Italian ) sacra <ORGANIZATION>Corona UNITA</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Cosa Nostra</PERSON> , the Turkish , Russian , Macedonian and Kosovar mafia , and the Colombian drug cartels .
<PERSON>Bujar Mema</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Albanian Interpol Office</ORGANIZATION> stated that drug smugglers have reappeared due to increasing consumption of narcotics in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the production of opium from <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> , which has reached the level of the years before the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> intervention in <DATE>2001</DATE> with 3600 tons produced in <DATE>2003</DATE> .

Pakistani analysts said on 050715 that <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> 's network of madrassa Islamic schools has close links with Islamic extremists in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> , who supply them with extremist recruits and vital funding .
On 050714 British Foreign Secretary <PERSON>Jack Straw</PERSON> expressed concern over what goes on in some Pakistani madrassas .
It has emerged that <PERSON>Shehzad Tanweer</PERSON> was one of the terrorists who carried out the bombing of an underground subway train at <LOCATION>Aldgate</LOCATION> in east <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> .
Tanweer was said by his uncle to have gone in 041200 to a Pakistani madrassa , wanting to learn to recite the Koran by heart .
Sources in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> said that British authorities should look inside British borders where the South Asian community is turning to increasingly extremist religious views .
Kamila hyat of <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Human Rights Commision</ORGANIZATION> said that militancy is being exported in the reverse direction .
Younger Pakistanis coming from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> have very extreme and hard - line views and view British culture as decadent .
When Pakistani - British youngsters come to <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> they are surprised to see women walking around without burqas .
Analysts say <PERSON>Tanweer</PERSON> 's trip to <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> was by no means unusual , as many Pakistani families who emigrated some 40 or 50 years ago and settled in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> send their children for religious teaching at madrassas .
Hyat said they want to ensure their children are not alienated from their family faith and hope a brief stint of a few terms will help ground them in Islamic and Pakistani culture .
Hyat said that complaints have nonetheless been received from parents in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> who are very concerned about teenagers who graduate and then go back to the <ORGANIZATION>UK for University</ORGANIZATION> .
The parents of some madrassa students are saying that the young men are somewhat confused when away from the UK for the first time and are consistently being approached by other Pakistanis or by Arabs who attempt to get them to join extremist groups .
Such students bring extremism back to the <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> when coming back home .
Madrassas continue to produce a peculiar state of mind in students , said <PERSON>Hasan Askari</PERSON> .

Authorizing of <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> sanctions against <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> meets difficulties due to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> 's disagreement with <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> over the sovereignty of <LOCATION>Gibraltar</LOCATION> .
Diplomatic sources said on 070208 that <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> sanctions against <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> cannot go forward due to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> 's disagreement with <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> over the sovereignty of <LOCATION>Gibraltar</LOCATION> inhibiting <LOCATION>Gibraltar</LOCATION> 's Chief Secretary from being listed as one of the required competent authorities .
The <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> decided in 061100 to ban the export of arms and nuclear and missile technology as well as luxury products in compliance with the UN resolution number <DATE>1718</DATE> adopted after <LOCATION>Pyongyang</LOCATION> carried out nuclear tests in 061000 .
The <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> also introduced restrictions of entry to the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> for individuals deemed to be aiding <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> 's programs for nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .
Before the measures are applied , the legal sanctions document requires a list of authorities , banks and other bodies in each <ORGANIZATION>Member State</ORGANIZATION> which would supervise compliance with the sanctions and freeze assets .
British spokeswoman <PERSON>Vicky Courtney</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> said <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> insisted that <LOCATION>Gibraltar</LOCATION> 's Chief Secretary be listed as the competent authority as had done on previous occasions without <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> making any complaint .
Gibraltar 's Chief Secretary acts as the link between the gibraltan government and the British government and Governor .
Another diplomatic source , said the Spanish government was afraid that any mention of a gibraltan authority would constitute a precedent in relations between the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Gibraltar</LOCATION> and so opposed the move this time .
The Government of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> insists that <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> should be named in the annex to the document but not <LOCATION>Gibraltar</LOCATION> .
The Spanish Government refuses to afford any international legitimacy to <LOCATION>Gibraltar</LOCATION> .
The <ORGANIZATION>UK</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> are seeking to reach a formula which would satisfy both sides .
The 2 <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> nations have thus far failed to do so .
<PERSON>Courtney</PERSON> said there is some frustration with the fact that the sanctions are being held up .
Courtney added that it is important to find a constructive solution applicable to this and other documents in future and said that the application of other sanctions also runs the risk of being blocked .
Other <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> - levied sanctions include those against <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> over the Iranian nuclear program .

Illegal arms trafficking increases in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> due to easy availability and neighboring conflicts .
Government initiatives to disarm have been ineffective .
Illegal arms trafficking has increased in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> and raised concern about security .
<PERSON>Daniel kiptugen</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Oxfam</ORGANIZATION> stated that there are approximately 140,000 illegal arms in circulation in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> among the most vulnerable and marginalized groups .
Illegal weapons are easily procured in urban open - air markets despite a government initiative launched in <DATE>2006</DATE> to curb the availability of arms .
Kenyan security minister <PERSON>John Michuki</PERSON> recently stated at a ceremony burning 8000 illegal arms seized in <DATE>2006</DATE> to prevent the spread of firearms --
Firearms fuel the illegal exploitation of natural resources and abet terrorism and other crimes .
The easy affordability and accessibility of arms reduces incentives to pursue non - violent solutions to conflicts and initiates a spiral of insecurity .
Police stated that conflicts along <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> 's borders have increased the number of weapons in the area .
Conflicts include a 20 - year insurgency in <LOCATION>Uganda</LOCATION> , anarchy in <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> since <DATE>1991</DATE> and the former civil war in <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> .
Police spokesman <PERSON>Gideon kibunjah</PERSON> stated --
<LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> has always experienced serious arms trafficking but the free sale of arms in <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> presents an additional problem .
Weapons smuggling has increased since 20061200 when Ethiopian - Somali troops eradicated an Islamist movement from south and central <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> .
Mogadishu experienced chaos and arms control at the border with <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> became a low - priority issue .
<LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> has participated since <DATE>2000</DATE> in a regional treaty to control and reduce the number of illegal arms in the <LOCATION>Great Lakes and Horn of Africa</LOCATION> but has achieved limited success in disarmament .
Kiptugen stated --
The impact of government disarmament programs had not yet been apparent .
Forced disarmament process has never been successful because it fails to address the impetus of the demand : competition for natural resources and a lack of government security forces .
Pastoral communities in northern <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> frequently resolve tribal conflicts concerning water and land access by gun battles .
Communities consider guns a means of self - protection and protection of the community 's livelihood .
Gun Control activist <PERSON>Walter Odhiambo</PERSON> stated that increased economic inequity in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> is a catalyst for violence .
2/3 of the population subsists on under 1 dollar per day .
The Kenyan government has increased promises to augment security measures before President <PERSON>Mwai Kibaki</PERSON> contends for re - election in 20071200 .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> issued a travel advisory to <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> citizens warning of increasing incidents of violent crime after 2 Americans were shot and killed in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> in 20070100 .
<LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> has struggled to overcome a reputation of high crime rates and frequent terrorist threats after the country experienced deadly terrorist attacks in <DATE>1998</DATE> and <DATE>2002</DATE> , ongoing tribal conflicts and a crime wave that killed 50 in 20070100 .

<LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION> has decided to develop and produce rockets and missiles .
Jane 's <ORGANIZATION>Defence Weekly</ORGANIZATION> reported on 070412 that the <ORGANIZATION>Thai Government</ORGANIZATION> has decided to develop and produce rockets and missiles in a radical shift towards building an indigenous defense industry .
Jane 's said the program would lift <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> beyond the current capacity for producing explosives , ammunition and small arms under licence as well as modernizing and repairing aircraft and armored vehicles .
The Thai armed forces do not currently have any surface - to - surface missiles in their inventory .
Jane 's cited an internal <ORGANIZATION>Thai Defense Ministry</ORGANIZATION> document which said <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> will start by developing a multiple - launch rocket ( MLR ) with a range of 80 kilometers ( 48 miles ) .
<PERSON>Jane</PERSON> 's said there is already a project underway to develop a 160 millimeter MLR with a 40 - kilometer range and that other projects include a strategic rocket with turbojet engine guided by Global Position System and inertial navigation system .
The <ORGANIZATION>Thai Ministry</ORGANIZATION> document says funding pressures on the defense budget and encouragement by unspecified sectors for greater self - sufficiency is driving the new program .
Such a rocket is significant because of the implication of efforts to develop a surface - to - surface missile with a range at the upper limit of the voluntary <ORGANIZATION>Missile Technology Control Regime</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>MTCR</ORGANIZATION> ) .
The <ORGANIZATION>MTCR</ORGANIZATION> is a global disarmament group involving the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and 33 other members and was established in 870000 to control exports of missiles which can deliver weapons of mass destruction .
<LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>King bhumipol Adulyadej</ORGANIZATION> enjoys strong support from the armed forces which overthrew the Thai government in a bloodless coup in 060900 and has called for a sufficiency economy .
Jane 's added that the new research and development program was launched before the coup but gained formal approval upon submission to the country 's <ORGANIZATION>Defense Council</ORGANIZATION> about a month afterwards .

<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> 's government announced withdrawal from the <ORGANIZATION>Conventional Forces</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> arms control treaty in hopes that the accompanying uncertainty will pressure European regarding various military , economic , and political issues .
The Russian government announced on 070714 suspension of Russian adherence to the <ORGANIZATION>Conventional Forces</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> ( CFE ) arms control treaty .
The <ORGANIZATION>CFE</ORGANIZATION> is a key agreement that limits the deployment of forces in central and eastern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> .
US moves to install anti - missile bases in the region were seen as a key cause of the decision .
Analysts said that it is <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> that is likely to suffer most from the decision 's consequences .
Independent defense analyst <PERSON>Pavel Felgenhauer</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>CFE Treaty</ORGANIZATION> is much more important to the European countries than the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> .
Felgenhauer pointed out that <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> has other problems with <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and that this withdrawal is another factor reducing confidence and deteriorating relations especially with European countries .
Felgenhauer predicted that actual troop deployments are unlikely to change much and believed the biggest practical effect of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> 's decision will be an end to mutual inspections and confidence - building measures governed by the Treaty .
Analysts said the hope in the <ORGANIZATION>Russian Government</ORGANIZATION> is that the uncertainty will weaken European resolve over a number of issues .
Interfax news agency cited <PERSON>Ivan safranchuk</PERSON> of the international center on defense information as saying that the situation will push <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> into a more active position on missile defense .
<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> has largely backed US plans for an anti - missile radar station in the <LOCATION>Czech Republic</LOCATION> and interceptor rockets in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> .
The Russian government says the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> plans threaten to upset the balance of power on the continent .
Other analysts were doubtful that attempts to pressure the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> would bear fruit .
Editor of the <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> - based Journal <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> in global affairs <PERSON>Fyodor Lukyanov</PERSON> said the Russian government is hoping that <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> 's extreme unease over this will lead to a softening of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> 's positions .
Lukyanov thinks the Russian government 's calculations are wrong and that a frightened <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> will join with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .
<PERSON>Lukyanov</PERSON> said the decision to freeze the <ORGANIZATION>CFE</ORGANIZATION> was part of a wider move by the Russian government to use newly found strength to remold the foundations of transatlantic relations and that the Russian government wants to revise the forces influencing interaction in the <ORGANIZATION>Euro</ORGANIZATION> - <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> area that were set when <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> was weaker .
Political analyst and director of <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Institute for globalization Boris Kagarlitsky</ORGANIZATION> said the Russian government also appears to be using its geopolitical strength to put pressure on <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> over business ties .
Kagarlitsky said the withdrawal from the Treaty will be seen in the West as an attempt to put pressure on a number of issues including in the economic sphere .
Disagreements over energy security and a dispute over deliveries of Polish meat have prevented Russian and <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> authorities from agreeing to a new mutual cooperation agreement .
Kagarlitsky said that at some stage the Russian government will put all of the economic issues on the table while expressing doubt whether the Russian government 's goals will be achieved .

The Government of <LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION> has lobbied for the chairmanship arguing it has a stable political situation , multilateral foreign policy and strong economy distinguishing it from other former Soviet countries .
Several <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> member States have questioned <LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION> 's democratic credentials .

Kazakhstan President <PERSON>Nursultan Nazarbayev</PERSON> 's political party Nur Otan won all the seats in the parliamentary election held in <DATE>August 2007</DATE> .
The choice of the <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> chairmanship is made by consensus .
Opposition by 1 country would be enough to deny <LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION> the chairmanship .
British newspaper <ORGANIZATION>The Financial Times</ORGANIZATION> reported on 27 <DATE>November 2007</DATE> that <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> officials will offer <LOCATION>Kazakhstan</LOCATION> a deal organized by <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> under which the country would assume the rotating chairmanship in <DATE>2010</DATE> or <DATE>2011</DATE> .
<ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Virginie coulloudon</PERSON> stated that such a deal is 1 scenario among 5 or 6 others .

<ORGANIZATION>UN Office on Drugs</ORGANIZATION> and Crime representative <PERSON>Christina Oguz</PERSON> stated that <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> has done little to stop the corruption enabling drug trade and <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> 's institutions are too weak to combat drug trade .
Drug production will be a main focus of a meeting in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> to assess progress in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> .
<ORGANIZATION>UN Office on Drugs</ORGANIZATION> and Crime representative <PERSON>Christina Oguz</PERSON> stated that <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> has done little to stop the corruption enabling drug trade and <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> 's institutions are too weak to combat drug trade .
Oguz stated to <ORGANIZATION>AFP</ORGANIZATION> in an interview that the drug industry in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> produces more than <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the world 's illegal opium and that ending the industry in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> will take decades .
Drug production escalated in <DATE>2007</DATE> and furthers deteriorating security .
Drug production will be a main focus of ministers , donors and aid agencies meeting in <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> on 5 <DATE>February 2008</DATE> through 6 <DATE>February 2008</DATE> to assess progress in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> .
A paper prepared for the talks said the expansion of the narcotics industry represents the single greatest threat to afghanistan 's stability and is increasingly linked to insecurity and terrorist activities .
The source of the document is the website of the joint coordination and monitoring board ( jcmb ) which is a committee working to implement <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> 's 5 - year reconstruction plan .
The paper said the drug trade funds terrorism , fuels corruption and undermines the rule of law that should bring security to the people of <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> .
The paper said traffickers provide weapons , funding and personnel to anti - government rebels while corrupt officials offer protection of drug trade routes , poppy fields and people .
6 , <PERSON>Oguz</PERSON> stated a focus of the <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> talks will be the need for immediate action in lieu of talking .
Oguz stated --
The fact that President <PERSON>Hamid Karzai</PERSON> has not appointed a counternarcotics minister to replace the minister who resigned in <DATE>July 2008</DATE> indicates the priority given to drug production even though <PERSON>Karzai</PERSON> has said drug production is 1 of the most important issues for <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> to tackle .
Very little has been done to fight corruption .
Corruption feeds the industry in that farmers often have to pay a <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> tax to Afghan officials or Taliban insurgents .
Farmers must pay various bribes .
Farmers receive less than 1/4 of the <MONEY>4 billion dollars</MONEY> that annual trade earns which is equal to more than 1/2 of the legal gross domestic product .
No one questions how people have very low salaries but drive in expensive cars and live in expensive houses .
Typically only the couriers are arrested .
Oguz stated bigger criminals are extremely difficult to find .
Some are not living in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> despite being Afghans .
Afghanistan 's opium is increasingly converted into heroin inside <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> and supplies drug users in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Central Asia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> .
Oguz stated blaming <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> for the world 's heroin problem would be unfair as heroin production is a shared responsibility .
Chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin come primarily from the developed world and are illegally sent to <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> .
Oguz stated the national strategy to deal with the drugs trade should be tailored to the different circumstances in the 34 provinces .
13 provinces were declared opium - free in <DATE>2007</DATE> which is double the figure from <DATE>2006</DATE> .
Oguz stated --
The focus should be on interdiction in southern <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> because of the common interest between insurgents and drug traffickers to keep the south out of reach from the government in <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION> and the international aid community .
The north and center of <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> have more order and government structure and should be offered incentives like development to persuade farmers and other players to cease opium production .
Oguz stated the necessity of a long - term effort to combat the drug problem with <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> rebuilding from below - scratch .
Oguz stated the drug trade links into corruption and the insurgency and will not be an easy task to combat .
Oguz stated combating the drug trade in <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> took 20 years even though <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> had some functioning institutions .

<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> warns that new UN resolution against <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear program will complicate the nuclear issue .
<ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> meets in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> to discuss <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> issue .
20080303 deputy head of the country 's atomic energy organization <PERSON>Mohammad Saeedi</PERSON> stated --
A new <ORGANIZATION>UN Security Council</ORGANIZATION> resolution against <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear activities would be irrational and unlawful and complicate the standoff with Western nations rather than promoting resolution of the issue .
The path of the <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> and any new resolution lacks legal credibility .
Supporters should be held accountable for their illegal act .
20080303 the <ORGANIZATION>International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> ) board of governors met in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> to discuss the Iranian nuclear issue .
<ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> chief <ORGANIZATION>Mohammed ElBaradei</ORGANIZATION> demanded that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> address allegations of involvement in covert nuclear weapons work .
Iran denies seeking atomic weapons and claims that only to endeavor to enrich uranium to lower levels to create nuclear fuel for its rapidly increasing population .
Iran demands the closing of the nuclear case because the most recent <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> report stated that the Agency had made important progress in a 4 - year examination of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear program .
Saeedi stated that reports by <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON>Mohammed ElBaradei</PERSON> presented a clear picture of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear program .
The <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> stated --
The Agency remains unable to confirm the nature of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear program .
Iran continues to defy UN demands to suspend uranium enrichment .

Iran dismissed the allegations as baseless and the intelligence used to back them as spurious .
Saeedi stated that the <ORGANIZATION>Iranian Government</ORGANIZATION> has submitted an assessment of the claimed studies and has no remaining commitments in the matter .
Diplomats stated that the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> board was considering tabling a resolution pressuring <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> to reveal its disputed nuclear activities .
Iranian Ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH</ORGANIZATION> stated that countries on the board should resist the potential action because there are no suitable grounds for such a resolution .
The <ORGANIZATION>UN Security Council</ORGANIZATION> planned to increase sanctions on <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> later on 20080303 in an attempt to force <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> to suspend uranium enrichment that the West fears is aimed at producing a secret nuclear weapon .

Diplomats stated --
Depending on the outcome of the <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> vote , the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> board is considering tabling a separate resolution demanding that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> reveal its disputed nuclear activities .

The <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> board has not made a resolution in 2 years .
US envoy to the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA Gregory Schulte</ORGANIZATION> stated to reporters prior to the meeting --
Despite limited progress in addressing past issues , troubling questions remain about Iranian activities that strongly suggest a clandestine weapons - related program .
The <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> is likely to support the <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> 's call for <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> to suspend its enrichment - related activities
Indications of weapons work constituting a violation of <ORGANIZATION>NPT</ORGANIZATION> obligations and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's violation of <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> resolutions provide strong reason for the <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> to continue to investigate <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> .
ElBaradei 's latest report stated --
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> addressed the majority of outstanding questions about its past nuclear program but refused to address allegations about its purported nuclear weapons work .

Cluster bombs were first used in World War II and open in the air and scatter smaller bombs over a wide area .
The fact that many fail to detonate on impact have made them a risk to the lives of civilians for years .
The British military currently possesses 2 Types of cluster ammunition which are the artillery - fired m85 and the m73 launched from helicopters .
Campaigners claim British troops used the m85 bombs in the <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> war in 030000 .

<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> is leading a technology transfer initiative developed by the G - 8 countries which will improve the technology of developing countries .
The goal of the initiative is to provide the infrastructure and good governance needed to alleviate poverty .
<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> sponsors technology transfer to developing countries as a form of foreign aid and alleviating poverty .
Premier <PERSON>Silvio Berlusconi</PERSON> supported and sponsored the initiative with counterparts at recent international gatherings including the last G - <DATE>8</DATE> Summit in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> .
<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> persuaded partners to let <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> lead the G - <DATE>8</DATE> summit 's e-government initiative called <ORGANIZATION>DOT Force</ORGANIZATION> or digital opportunity task force .
Former <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> executive and current technology minister of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> <PERSON>Lucio Stanca</PERSON> is leading <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> 's Internet program for developing countries as part of <ORGANIZATION>the Group of Eight</ORGANIZATION> 's efforts to reduce the digital divides .

So far <MONEY>12 million euros</MONEY> or <MONEY>12 million dollars</MONEY> have been allocated to finance the initial phase of these projects .
This cost is only a fraction of the total cost .
<LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> is financing most of the cost but <ORGANIZATION>the World Bank</ORGANIZATION> and possibly some private telecommunications companies are also contributing .
<PERSON>Lucio Stanca</PERSON> stated that the world must solve the problem of world hunger , disease and education but in order to do that the world must first help create good governance .
The rationale behind creating good governance is that by making the public administration of developing countries more transparent and accountable developing countries would become more attractive potential recipients of traditional forms of aid such as loans and investments .
In effect good governance would invalidate the reason used by countries that do not do enough that donating is not appropriate because it is impossible to know whether the aid would reach its true destination .
The <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> telecommunications agency stated that 83 countries in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> , and the former <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> still have less than 10 telephone lines for every 100 people .
Other studies note that even though the Internet has been in use for more than a decade , only about <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of the world 's population has access to it .
Reducing the digital divide has taken on a central role in the fight against global poverty in recent years .
The <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> has repeatedly stated that the world 's poor may be further marginalized if there is no improvement in access to information technology .
Reducing the digital divide was declared a priority at last year 's G - <DATE>8</DATE> Summit in <LOCATION>Genoa</LOCATION> which included <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> .
Italy launched pilot programs in 5 countries at a conference in <LOCATION>Sicily</LOCATION> sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> in <DATE>April , 2002</DATE> .

Philippine intelligence reports obtained by the <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> reveal a <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> - based al-Qaida group 's plans to attack embassies of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> , to attack <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> corporations and warships in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and to crash a hijacked plane at the country 's international airport .
The group ordered a chemist to buy 4 tons of ammonium nitrate .
The amount is 4 times the amount of explosive that <PERSON>Timothy McVeigh</PERSON> used to bomb the <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION> Federal Building .
The embassy attacks were successfully stopped in the final stages by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> investigators and allies in <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> but the explosives were not recovered .
1 of the phillipine reports states that <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> is a target for terrorist attacks because of its 17000 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> residents and <DATE>6000</DATE> multinational companies including several American companies .
The terrorists belonged to Jemaah Islamiah designated by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government as a terrorist organization and described in 1 of the phillipine reports as part of the broader al-Qaida syndicate .
The group planned attacks in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> before and after the hijackings in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> on 11 <DATE>September 2001</DATE> .
The group is believed responsible for attacks throughout <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> .
The group is suspected in the bombings in <LOCATION>Bali</LOCATION> that killed approximately 200 people in <DATE>October 2002</DATE> .
The attacks in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> were prevented after 15 individuals were arrested in <DATE>December 2001</DATE> .
2 of the individuals arrested were released .
1 of the Philippine reports stated that local officials and Western business executives were shocked by the ability of Al-Qaida to plant operatives in such a tightly controlled society as <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> .
The members of the 4 or 5 - man terror cells led normal lives and avoided contact with known Islamic organizations .
The members were not known to be active members of mosques in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> .
In efforts to avoid detection the members used code names and code numbers , communicated by e-mail , encrypted their computer diskettes and used prepaid mobile phone cards .
Investigators stated that after the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military campaign began in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> members of Jemaah Islamiah planned to procure 21 tons of explosive materials and bought 4 tons of ammonium nitrate in an operation to attack embassies in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> .
The ammonium nitrate was purchased by captured Malaysian chemist and retired army captain <PERSON>Yazid Sufaat</PERSON> .
Authorities state that <PERSON>Sufaat</PERSON> hosted 11 <DATE>September</DATE> hijackers and the accused terrorism suspect <PERSON>Zacarias Moussaoui</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> at different times in <DATE>2000</DATE> .
Authorities state that <PERSON>Sufaat</PERSON> provided Moussaoui with counterfeit documents with which to enter the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .
Moussaoui was arrested in <DATE>August 2001</DATE> in <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> and remains the only <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> defendant indicted as a conspirator with the perpetrators of the 11 <DATE>September</DATE> attacks .
The Singaporean cell members were believed to be conducting reconnaissance when they were apprehended .
The explosive materials were sent to an Indonesian island off <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> .
During the attack planning an Indonesian and a Kuwaiti arrived in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> with instructions for the embassy operations .
Cell members guided them to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> embassy which was videotaped including close - up shots .
The adjoining Australian embassy was also videotaped .
In a separate plot a member of the cell took digital photographs of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military aircraft and personnel using <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> 's <PERSON>Paya Lebar</PERSON> air base .
<LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> authorities believe a cell leader traveled to <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> and briefed al-Qaida leaders about the proposed shuttle bus attack between <DATE>August 1999</DATE> and <DATE>April 2000</DATE> .
The al-Qaida officials apparently turned down the plan because the target was not large enough .
A few days after the <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> arrests in <DATE>December 2001</DATE> a videotape was found in an abandoned house in <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> in which a narrator describes locations in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> where bombs could be hidden to attack Americans .
Investigators searched the homes of those detained in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> and found an identical videotape .
The <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> wing of <LOCATION>Jemaah Islamiah</LOCATION> may also have Thai connections since at least 5 members who eluded the <DATE>2001</DATE> arrests fled to <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> .
1 of the reports stated --
The group had previously plotted to conduct 7 simultaneous explosions in different areas of <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> .
The Group had further planned to hijack a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> , British or Singaporean plane and crash it into <LOCATION>Changi Airport</LOCATION> in order to threaten the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government to halt its military strikes against <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> .
In <DATE>February 2003</DATE> Indonesian police announced the arrest of the alleged head of the cell in <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> Mas <PERSON>Selamat Kastari</PERSON> who was suspected of planning the airport attack .
<PERSON>Kastari</PERSON> also was suspected in the proposed shuttle bus attack .
The reports arose after intelligence agents from Southeast Asian countries realized after the 11 <DATE>September 2001</DATE> attacks that many radical Islamic groups in the region had close connections to each other and to <LOCATION>Osama</LOCATION> bin <ORGANIZATION>Laden</ORGANIZATION> 's terrorist network .

<PERSON>ElBaradei</PERSON> said much of the material that is reported stolen is never recovered and that a lot of the material recovered has never been reported stolen .
<PERSON>ElBaradei</PERSON> said in reference to <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> that the international community should quickly engage in talks with the Iranian government to secure guarantees that the Iranian nuclear program will not be used to develop weapons and that such confidence can only be built through direct negotiations .
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON>Joe Lieberman</PERSON> said that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> remained the world 's top arms control challenge and that it would be a profound mistake to focus on the recent <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> national intelligence estimate that suggested <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> no longer had a nuclear weapons program .
Lieberman pointed out that in the Nie report which said that the Iranian government 's covert work on bomb design may have been temporarily suspended in 03000 it was also and far more importantly stated that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's overt work on enrichment continues apace .
German foreign minister <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> - <PERSON>Walter Steinmeier</PERSON> similarly emphasized that the Nie report in no way grants <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> any kind of absolution .
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> has been working with the 5 permanent <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Security Council</ORGANIZATION> members on the Iranian nuclear issue .
Steinmeier consequently believes it is right for the international community to keep up the pressure on <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> .
Steinmeier said that in the interests of global safety the international community 's common goals must continue to be to prevent Iranian nuclear armament and to counteract the erosion of the <ORGANIZATION>Nonproliferation Treaty</ORGANIZATION> .

<LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> is worried about rebel plan involving obtaining uranium but has no evidence of plot for dirty bomb .
The Colombian government is worried about documents on the laptop of a slain rebel leader indicating the guerrillas were trying to obtain uranium .
Colombian Vice President <PERSON>Francisco Santos</PERSON> had told the 65 - member Conference on Disarmament on 080304 that the <ORGANIZATION>Colombian Government</ORGANIZATION> was alarmed because uranium is the primary basis for generating dirty weapons of mass destruction and for terrorism .
Santos backed off slightly and told the <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> on 080305 that Colombian authorities have no evidence or indication that the <ORGANIZATION>Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia</ORGANIZATION> are seeking to use the uranium to build a radioactive dirty bomb .
Santos said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> that what <PERSON>Santos</PERSON> had meant was to take note and not take it lightly and said that putting the <ORGANIZATION>FARC</ORGANIZATION> rebels and the word uranium in the same sentence was alarming .
The <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> has an office in <LOCATION>Bogota</LOCATION> and Spokesman <PERSON>Richard kolko</PERSON> said in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> has no information or intelligence regarding the <ORGANIZATION>FARC</ORGANIZATION> attempting to use weapons of mass destruction .
The <ORGANIZATION>FARC</ORGANIZATION> has been fighting successive Colombian Governments for more than 4 decades using conventional weapons .
The document addressing uranium was found in a laptop belonging to a top <ORGANIZATION>FARC</ORGANIZATION> commander named <PERSON>Raul Reyes</PERSON> .
Reyes was killed on 080301 in a raid into <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION> that has generated intense international criticism .
The poorly written communication addressed to <PERSON>Reyes</PERSON> was dated 080216 and was signed by <PERSON>Edgar Tovar</PERSON> .
Santos said <PERSON>Tovar</PERSON> commands a <ORGANIZATION>FARC</ORGANIZATION> front near <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION> .
Tovar wrote that a man named Belisario in <LOCATION>Bogota</LOCATION> supplies <PERSON>Tovar</PERSON> with explosives and sent <PERSON>Tovar</PERSON> a catalog and specifications .
Tovar wrote that Belisario proposed to sell each kilo at <ORGANIZATION>US</ORGANIZATION> <MONEY>$ 2.5 million</MONEY> and deliver it and that <PERSON>Tovar</PERSON> and <PERSON>Reyes</PERSON> would then find a buyer .
Tovar wrote the deal would be with a <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> and to sell them a sizable amount .
Tovar wrote <PERSON>Belisario</PERSON> had 50 kilos ready and could sell a lot more as <PERSON>Belisario</PERSON> had direct contact with uranium suppliers .
The uranium reference in <PERSON>Tovar</PERSON> 's writing was quickly cited by <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> 's government while seeking to deflect criticism over the raid .
Gen. <PERSON>Oscar Naranjo</PERSON> said at an explosive news conference that the <ORGANIZATION>FARC</ORGANIZATION> mentioning negotiations for 50 kilos of uranium means that the <ORGANIZATION>FARC</ORGANIZATION> are taking big steps in the world of terrorism to become a global aggressor and were not just domestic guerrillas but transnational terrorists .
Santos took <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> 's complaints to the <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> 's foreign affairs representative <PERSON>Javier Solano</PERSON> on 080305 .
Santos told the <ORGANIZATION>AP</ORGANIZATION> after meeting with <PERSON>Solano</PERSON> that the Europeans were really worried about the uranium and were not taking the issue lightly .
Colombian officials say they have no other information from the laptop or other sources indicating <ORGANIZATION>FARC</ORGANIZATION> interest in radioactive materials or unconventional weapons .
It was n't clear what exactly the material <PERSON>Tovar</PERSON> was writing about might be .
Santos said the uranium mentioned in the communication sounded like processed uranium .
The price mentioned suggests that the uranium would be processed and hence dangerous .
<PERSON>Charles Ferguson</PERSON> is a physicist with the <ORGANIZATION>Council on Foreign Relations</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and said that unprocessed uranium is relatively harmless and goes for about US <MONEY>$ 100</MONEY> a kilo .
Ferguson expressed fear if the uranium in question were the highly enriched weapons - grade uranium capable of being used in a low - yield improvised nuclear device .
<PERSON>Ferguson</PERSON> was not aware of any highly enriched uranium of appreciable quantities in the region near <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> .

<PERSON>Maseko</PERSON> 's comments were the strongest issued on the subject by the <ORGANIZATION>South African Government</ORGANIZATION> to date .
South African President <PERSON>Thabo Mbeki</PERSON> is the main mediator in <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> .
<PERSON>Mbeki</PERSON> has stated that there is no crisis in <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> despite the increasing violence and intimidation since the 29 <DATE>March 2008</DATE> vote and the refusal of <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> 's election commission to release results that independent observers and the opposition <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> show President <PERSON>Robert Mugabe</PERSON> lost the vote .
Critics call the South African reaction appeasement .
Criticism increased on 17 <DATE>April 2008</DATE> following a report that South African mediator <PERSON>Sydney Mufamadi</PERSON> led an arms control committee meeting that approved transit of a shipment of Chinese weapons across South African territory en route to <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> .
The Chinese ship called an <PERSON>Yue Jiang</PERSON> docked in <LOCATION>Durban</LOCATION> harbor in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> after receiving approval from <LOCATION>Port</LOCATION> authorities late on 16 <DATE>April 2008</DATE> .
The Beeld newspaper stated the ship was carrying approximately 3 million rounds of ammunition for small arms and AK - 47s , approximately 3500 mortars and mortar launchers and <DATE>1500</DATE> rockets for rocket - propelled grenades .

After a cabinet meeting <PERSON>Maseko</PERSON> stated to reporters --
The Government of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> cannot act unilaterally to prevent a trade deal between 2 countries .
<LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> is not involved in the arrangement .
It would be possible but very difficult for <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> to intervene and to disallow the shipment .
There was presently no trade embargo against <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> .
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is one of <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> 's main trade partners and allies .
A group representing mainly white <LOCATION>South Africans</LOCATION> called afriforum stated it would organize protests along the route to <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> .
Afriforum 's kallie <PERSON>kriel</PERSON> stated that the <ORGANIZATION>National Conventional Arms Control Committee</ORGANIZATION> had granted approval for the transit of the weapons on 14 <DATE>April 2008</DATE> .
Kriel stated he had written to <ORGANIZATION>Committee Chairman and Local Government Minister Sydney Mufamadi</ORGANIZATION> asking him to retract the permission .
Kriel stated that the <ORGANIZATION>South African Government</ORGANIZATION> 's approval for the transport of the arms across South African territory effectively means that the government is replacing its ineffective policy of silent diplomacy with a more catastrophic policy of complicity with the <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> violence and human rights violations committed by the Zimbabwean government against its own citizens .
The South African opposition Democratic Alliance agreed with <PERSON>kriel</PERSON> 's comments .
Mufamadi also heads the South African mediating team between <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> 's ruling ZANU - PF party and the opposition <ORGANIZATION>Movement for Democratic Change</ORGANIZATION> .

<PERSON>January Masilela</PERSON> stated that if the buyer is the Zimbabwean sovereign government and the seller is the Chinese sovereign government , <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> has nothing to do with the transaction because <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> works according to established international conventions which allow the nation no jurisdiction over goods in transit .

International treaties targeted weapons proliferation by Governments until Resolution <DATE>1540</DATE> was adopted in 040000 there was no legal instrument to prevent terrorists , criminal scientists , black marketeers and other non - State actors from obtaining weapons of mass destruction .
Resolution 1540 was introduced as the <ORGANIZATION>International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> was investigating a vast black market in nuclear equipment and technology .
The black market investigation was encouraged by <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> 's admission in 040200 that <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> 's leading nuclear scientist had passed technology to <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> .
<LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> 's leading nuclear scientist , was <PERSON>Abdul Qadeer Khan</PERSON> .

The <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> stated that not all States have presented to the Resolution 1540 Committee the state 's national reports on implementation of Resolution <DATE>1540</DATE> and that the full implementation of Resolution 1540 by all States is a long - term task that will require continuous efforts at national , regional and international levels .
The <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> stated that full implementation of Resolution 1540 by all States includes the adoption of national laws and measures to ensure implementation of the Resolution 1540 inspired national laws .

A leading arms expert stated that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's improved nuclear arsenal raises questions about the Chinese government 's future arms control efforts .
The expert praised <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> officials for decreasing sales of weapons abroad .
A leading arms expert stated on 8 <DATE>May 2008</DATE> that Chinese government is making dramatic improvements to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's nuclear arsenal which raises questions for future arms control efforts .
Director of the <ORGANIZATION>Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Bates Gill</ORGANIZATION> spoke at a panel for journalists while on a visit to <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> to promote an annual report on the global arms industry .
Gill stated --
Recent upgrades have increased the accuracy and mobility of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's arsenal while a switch from liquid to solid fuel has shortened reaction times .
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> stands out due to the effort to modernize , expand and improve nuclear weapons capability .
Among the 5 nuclear <ORGANIZATION>Powers China</ORGANIZATION> is making the most dramatic improvements in nuclear force which raises arms control questions .
The <ORGANIZATION>Chinese Government</ORGANIZATION> stated <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> will never be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's arsenal , estimated at just over 100 nuclear - armed missiles , is the smallest of the 5 main nuclear weapon Powers .
Chinese officials signed the <ORGANIZATION>Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1992</DATE> and gill stated the recent steps are aimed mainly at reducing the vulnerability of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's deterrent force .
Gill stated that improvements in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's conventional military are even more dramatic after more than 10 years of double - digit percentage increases in annual defense spending .
Gill stated the large increase in the military capability of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is targeted mostly at <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> but has the possibility going forward with force projection elsewhere .
<LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> is a self - governing island that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> claims is part of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's territory and has threatened to invade .
Gill stated that the increase in military capability complicates the issue of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> as a player in the arms control agenda and that the Chinese government would need to be engaged in future efforts to cap or reduce numbers of nuclear weapons .
<PERSON>Gill</PERSON> praised <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> officials for decreasing sales of weapons and military technology abroad which <PERSON>Gill</PERSON> believes was largely done out of a desire to be viewed as a more responsible player in international society .
According to the <ORGANIZATION>Stockholm International Peace Research Institute China</ORGANIZATION> has only a <PERCENT>2 percent</PERCENT> share of the global arms export trade .
Gill stated that the shift in the way the Chinese government views the problem of nonproliferation is very positive .
<PERSON>Gill</PERSON> stated that authorities need to strengthen regulation to prevent weapons from entering conflict zones , particularly in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> where Chinese arms are used by both government and rebel forces in <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> 's <LOCATION>Darfur</LOCATION> region .
Retired People 's <ORGANIZATION>Liberation Army Colonel Teng</ORGANIZATION> jianqun spoke alongside <PERSON>Gill</PERSON> on the panel and stated that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has substantial restrictions on weapons sales abroad .
Teng conceded that some dealers violated the rules and were beyond the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> 's direct control .
Teng stated that further steps were being taken to boost awareness of the rules , partly through courses for government and defense industry leaders run by the foreign ministry - sponsored <ORGANIZATION>China Arms Control and Disarmament Association</ORGANIZATION> of which <ORGANIZATION>Teng</ORGANIZATION> is Deputy Secretary - General .
Teng stated a belief that the Chinese have been putting more effort into export controls .
