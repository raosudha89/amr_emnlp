A United Nation nuclear team will make a week - long visit to North Korea this weekend to inspect the Stalinist state 's controversial nuclear site .
Government sources said on January 7 , 2002 that a united nation nuclear team will make a week - long visit to North Korea this weekend to inspect the Stalinist state 's controversial nuclear site .
The upcoming visit is viewed as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) drive to clarify North Korea 's nuclear ambitions .
A government source stated the visit by a group of IAEA safety experts is scheduled to last for a week beginning January 12 , 2002 .
The source stated that the inspection would focus on an isotope production laboratory in the Yongbyon nuclear complex which is north of North Korea 's capital Pyongyang .
The IAEA tour of the isotope production laboratory will unlikely give a full picture of North Korea 's suspected nuclear weapons ambitions .
The tour was a surprise offer made by North Korea in November 2001 .
IAEA accepted North Korea 's proposal last month but cautioned that the proposal is not a breakthrough .
IAEA also stated the lab is not one of the frozen facilities it wants to look into .
IAEA is based in Vienna and is the UN 's nuclear supervisor .
North Korea has denied the IAEA full access to its facilities .
North Korea froze its suspected nuclear weapons program at Yongbyon in exchange for receiving two nuclear reactors producing less weapons - grade plutonium under a 1994 accord with the United States .
The 4.6 - billion - dollar project was due to be completed by 2003 .
Delays have pushed back the finish until at least 2008 .
Pyongyang insists it will allow full IAEA inspections only when a significant portion of the project as defined in the 1994 accord is completed .

South Koreans rallied on January 11 , 2002 in support of their right to eat dog meat .
They threatened an Internet war as part of a campaign to defend the traditional cuisine .
A nationalist group has vowed cyber hostilities against U.S. based media company Warner Bros . and one of France 's state - run television channels .
The activists accuse the organizations of being culturally - biased and insulting .
A South Korean group has announced a campaign backed by food scientists to promote the eating of dog meat .
This announcement was in response to increasing foreign criticism of the way dogs are slaughtered in South Korea .
The killing of dogs for restaurants has become a more popular topic than the football World Cup finals .
The World Cup finals are to be co - hosted by South Korea and Japan this year .
The debate was partly fueled by FIFA , football 's international governing body .
FIFA urged South Korea to prevent the inhumane killing of dogs .
South Koreans are angered by the international pressure on their traditional cuisine .
The organizers of South Korean website antijapan . wo . ro vowed to paralyze the websites of Warner Bros . ( www.wpix.com ) and the French state television network ( www.francetv.fr ) on January 19 , 2002 .
The organizers of the South Korean website accused the broadcasters of falsely describing South Koreans and their food culture as barbaric .
The anti - Japan group stated that South Korean culture is under attack .
The statement was made to gain supporters to join the lobbying .
Cyber warfare has become a common weapon for South Koreans .
They are one of the most Internet savvy nations in the world .
South Korean cyber campaigners disabled Japanese education ministry websites last year in a protest against history books accused of skimming Japan 's wartime record in Asia .
The nationalist group was formed to campaign against Japan .
The group said the foreign broadcasters are battering the eating dogmeat culture and that it is insulting behavior .
It tramples on a tradition of one country .
The group said the foreign broadcasters do not show any remorse for their culture of eating snails and horses .
The cyber attack is to show the power of South Koreans and Asians against the West 's sense of superiority and ignorance of South Korea 's history .
Another group said they will launch an association next Monday of around 100 dog meat restaurant owners in the Seoul region and hold a seminar to promote the dish .
Food scientist at Chung Chong College an Yong - geun said he would introduce some 350 different kinds of culinary art with dog meat .
French actress - turned activist Brigitte Bardot and other animal rights campaigners call to stop the South Korean practice of eating dogs .
FIFA president Sepp Blatter sent a letter last November to South Korea 's World Cup organizing committee calling for immediate and decisive measures against cruelty to dogs .
It was ahead of the World Cup which starts May 31 , 2002 .
Head of the Korean Football Association and a FIFA vice president Chung Mong - Joon said FIFA should not intervene in the eating habits of a sovereign nation .
South Korean officials said most dogs used for eating were killed instantly by electrocution .
Activists contend many slaughterhouses in the countryside are not controlled .
They strangle dogs , hang them by a rope and beat them in line with traditional practice to make the meat more tender .
Dog restaurants were told to close or go into the backstreets when Seoul hosted the 1988 Olympics .
No similar move is planned for the World Cup .
The authorities say the practice is slowly disappearing in Korea .
A recent survey stated that about one million dogs are sold every year for food in South Korea and 92 percent of men aged 20 and above and 68 percent of adult women have tasted dog meat .

Tariq Jamil stated that he would examine if the baned literature is still available in the market despite the ban .
The 2 hardline militant groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir are the Lashkar - e - Taiba and Jaish - e - Mohammad .
The Lashkar - e - Taiba and Jaish - e - Mohammad are still distributing their message through a range of publications and magazines easily available in Karachi .
Other groups linked to terrorism and included on the United States Terrorist Exclusion List are also publishing regular newspapers and journals containing rhetoric that is against Western countries and calls for war in the name of Islam .
Qari Mohammad Zafar stated that his elders urged him to read about Jihad through the Islam daily published by the Al-Rashid Trust and Lashkar - i - Taiba 's zarb - e - Taiba weekly .

Over 12 publications including dailies , weeklies and monthlies of various extremist groups including those banned on 020112 still sell in large numbers in the markets and bazaars of Karachi .
Police officer Mohammad Iqbal stated that the police so far have not received any instructions to take action against any banned religious extremist publications .
Analysts stated that the Pakistani government may have trouble explaining the Pakistani government 's reasoning if the banned religious extremist groups ' publications are suddenly removed from the newsstands because the Pakistani Government generally supports the freedom of the press .
A reporter who did not want to be named from the publication of the Islam daily of Al-Rashid Trust stated that it would not be easy for the Pakistani government to ban the religious extremist publications and make over 500 employees jobless .

Canadian government 's warning of al-Qaeda 's capability to launch a cyberattack causes various industries to review their preparedness .
Critical infrastructures including energy and transportation providers cite close work with Government to remain aware of threats and to update accordingly .
A recent government warning that al-Qaeda terrorists could launch a cyberattack on Canadian interests or critical infrastructure has caused many concerned industries to review their security systems .
Vice President of Canadian electricity Association Francis Bradley stated that the company has a warning system for both physical and cyberattacks .
Bradley stated that the company has been significantly focused on prevention of cyberattacks .
In a recent interview Bradley stated that many utility firms perform a brief review of their multi - tiered response systems after such warnings are issued .
The warning from the Canadian Department of National Defense 's office of critical infrastructure protection and emergency service was quietly released on 20 December 2001 and cited no specific threat .
Director of threat analysis at the Canadian Department of National Defense 's office of critical infrastructure protection and emergency service Brenda hensler - Hobbs stated that following the attacks of 11 September 2001 the Canadian Government specifically examined the potential cyber - capability of al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden 's followers .
Hensler - Hobbs stated that the Canadian government has no knowledge of Al-Qaeda having engaged in cyberattacks in the past but that leader bin Laden has suggested that if he chose to launch cyberattacks he could have the means available to him .
In summary of the recent warning stating that such an attack could be executed in the very near future hensler - Hobbs stated that bin Laden 's location was irrelevant because bin Laden possesses the money and supporters necessary to have such an attack executed by others .
A number of al-Qaeda militants including Millennium plot bomber Ahmed Ressam are known to have remained in Canada .
Many are located in Montreal .
Hensler - Hobbs stated that the proliferation and availability of Hacker tools and the low skill level needed to conduct cyberattacks demonstrate the ease of launching an attack anywhere .
Hensler - Hobbs cited the example of the Montreal - based Hacker known as mafiaboy who attacked U.S. websites including Amazon.com in 2000 .
Many think that security must be improved at North American critical infrastructures including energy and transportation providers and the financial services sector that are largely interconnected .
Many businesses began preparing for cyber incidents before the year 2000 .
A separate report issued recently by the U.S. government - funded research group computer science and telecommunications Board stated that cyber security needs considerable improvement .
For example , according to a Canadian government estimate the love bug launched in May 2000 caused 6.7 billion U.S. dollars in damage and disrupted Canadian government systems .
Bell Canada spokesman Andrew Cole stated that Bell Canada is prepared and remains prepared for various potential situations and scenarios .
Cole stated --
Bell Canada works very closely with the Government and the private sector to be aware of security concerns and to update accordingly .
Bell Canada worked closely with U.S. officials and firms after the attacks of 11 September 2001 .
Bell Canada provides a total of 26 million phone and Internet connections to a nation of 30 million people .
Bradley stated --
Electricity firms have strong warning systems that are coordinated by the North American Electric reliability Council .
There has not been a cyber event that has resulted in a loss of power for utility customers .
There is little possibility that a cyberattack would disable a North American electric grid .
Electric companies are well prepared and are making all preparations required to be ready for any physical or cyberattack .
The North American Electric reliability Council 's 30 largest utility companies went on their highest alert on September 11 and many still have an increased security presence in effect and plan to extend it further .

Russia 's military authorities criticized Kamchatenergo Power Company for imposing a shutdown on supplies to a command center that guides military satellites in orbit and contributes to systems controlling the international space station .
The Kamchatenergo company disconnected a major control center of the Russian space forces located in Kamchatka early Saturday , the Russian Space Forces press service said .
Kamchatenergo feeds power to the vast Kamchatka peninsula in Russia 's far east .
A statement from the Russian Space Forces press services on 020126 called the action a direct violation of government decrees on defense facilities and stated that it could have led to the loss of a spacecraft costing hundreds of millions of rubles .
The monitoring center is a key element in maintaining Russia 's satellite network in orbit and plays a part in operations of the international space platform Alfa .
Officials at the command center took urgent measures to use reserve power units to keep the system functioning and to temporarily provide residential centers with electricity .
Several other military bases and strategic defense units were affected .
The State power monopoly United energy services and its regional subsidiary Kamchatenergo launched a program of power cuts to long - term debtors on 020125 .
United energy services argues that non - payment of bills has prevented it from maintaining supplies .
The Russian Space Forces , the space branch of Russia 's armed forces , expressed alarm at the prospect of further power cuts resulting from delays in Federal budget resources reaching local authorities on time .

The Kamchatka Command Center maintains Russia 's satellite network in orbit .
The Kamchatka command center plays a role in ISS operations .
cutting power to command centers could pose dangers for Russian space installations .
Power cuts could lead to a failure of all work with space craft .
The ISS could function for an orbit or two without ground control by using standby systems .
A total unexpected loss of power during control of military equipment could be catastrophic .
The Government or UES or the Ministry of Defense must resolve the issue .
The Kamchatenergo company feeds power to Kamchatka Peninsula .

An Australian jury found that an Uzbekistan Olympic boxing official was defamed in a book about alleged Olympic corruption in which he was depicted as a major international heroin dealer and racketeer .
A New South Wales Supreme Court jury took just over 2 hours on 020201 to find Gafur Rakhimov had been libelled in a book the Great Olympic swindle which alleges Olympic corruption .
Gafur Rakhimov is an Uzbekistan Olympic boxing official and was depicted in the book as a major international heroin dealer and racketeer .
The Great Olympic swindle was written by British journalist Andrew Jennings and published by Simon and Schuster .
The Rakhimov case will now go to a single judge to hear defences and decide any damages to be awarded to Rakhimov .
The Great Olympic swindle implied that Gafur Rakhimov had been engaged in fraud , prostitution , assassination , gun running and plutonium smuggling .
The book also implied that the businessman was a gangster in the Soviet black economy and had traded sporting medals for bribes .
Rakhimov was Vice - President of the Olympic Council of Asia and an Executive Member of the International Amateur Boxing Association .
Rakhimov was also said to have bribed members of the International Amateur Boxing Federation in the vote for the Federation Presidency .
Jennings is a long - time critic of the International Olympic Committee .
The 020201 verdict followed 2 defamation actions brought last year by Rakhimov against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) and Jennings and against the Sydney Morning Herald ( SMH ) and Jennings .
A jury found in the case involving the ABC that ABC 's flagship current affairs program four corners had implied Rakhimov knew some of the world 's most dangerous criminals and was suspected by the FBI of drug trafficking .
That Panel found those insinuations were not defamatory and threw out the case against the ABC and Jennings .
The SMH and Jennings were then sued over 3 articles published in the lead - up to the 000000 Olympics .
The jury in that case found Rakhimov had been painted as a major international criminal and had been defamed .

OSCE urges permanent end to Afghan terrorism and drug - trafficking to create long - term stability in Central Asia .
Expert states that cultivation of opium and drug trafficking are deeply entrenched in Afghanistan and will be impossible to eradicate .
On 10 February 2002 an official with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe was quoted as stating that long - term stability in Central Asia depends on eradicating post - Taliban Afghan terrorism and drug - trafficking .
The OSCE envoy in neighboring Tajikistan Marc Gilbert stated to the government weekly national gazette that there are now hopes that Afghanistan will develop its democratic institutions and end terrorism and drug - smuggling resulting in greater stability in Central Asia .
Gilbert stated that the post - Soviet republics in central Asia fought terrorism by giving material and other necessary help to the international anti - terrorist coalition in the war against Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden and the Taliban regime .
Both Tajikistan and Uzbekistan share a border with Afghanistan and have experienced raids by Taliban - backed Islamic militants in recent years .
Neighboring Kyrgyzstan has also experienced raids by Taliban - backed Islamic militants in recent years .
Kazakhstan also became a key U.S. partner in the Afghan war opening its airspace to military overflights .
Turkmenistan maintained a more neutral stance .
Turkmenistan borders Afghanistan .
Gilbert stated that Tajikistan 's positive and responsible approach to the crisis in Afghanistan has significantly improved the country 's image internationally .
Tajik government expert and head of the Tajik Drug Control Agency Vladimir Rakhmonov stated on 10 February 2002 that the U.S. - led war in Afghanistan had failed to stop drug trafficking across the border into Tajikistan .
Rakhmonov stated to Interfax --
Opium and heroin are a form of hard - currency reserve for Afghanistan .
Drug trafficking from Afghanistan has been concealed so securely that it will be impossible to uncover .
Drug trafficking from Afghanistan resumed during a brief hiatus in the anti - terrorist operation .
In 2001 Tajik law - enforcement agencies and Russian border guards seized 8.8 tons of drugs including 4.2 tons of heroin .
This represented a 26 percent increase overall in 2001 with 3 times the amount of heroin .
Suggestions that there are no longer drug lords in Afghanistan and that drug traffic into Tajikistan has been eradicated are unrealistic and false .
Many years would be needed to convert Afghanistan 's agriculture historically specialized in the growing of raw opium .
Cultivation of raw opium provided the only source of income for much of the rural population .
Tajikistan 's 780 - mile border with Afghanistan is patrolled by approximately 11000 Russian soldiers under a 1992 agreement between the Russian and Tajik Governments .

Afghan officials conducted talks with Russian officials asking for assistance in stopping Afghanistan 's large illegal opium and heroin trade .
Afghanistan seeks to end poppy harvesting and increase border control .
March 1 , 2002 interim interior minister of Afghanistan Yunus Qanooni asked Russian officials to assist in combating the drugs trade and establishing security in Afghanistan .
Qanooni is a member of the Northern Alliance .
Qanooni told Russian Deputy Minister for Emergency Situations Yury Vorobyov --
Unfortunately over the past six years , the rule of the Taliban turned Afghanistan into a center of terrorism and drugs .
The struggle against terrorism and against drugs , and the establishment of security is a priority for the Administration of Afghanistan .
But combating terrorism and drugs requires joint efforts .
Peace and stability in Afghanistan is not only in the interests of the Afghani people and nation but of all the countries in the region .
Afghanistan 's interim government stated that it would take firm measures very quickly to prevent the harvest of poppy in the wake of the Taliban regime 's fall late last year .
Leader of Afghanistan 's interim government Hamid Karzai said the fight against poppy harvesting and the lucrative trafficking of opium and heroin will be a top priority .
The anti - drug effort is strongly supported by Western countries , whose populations are a major market for heroin and opium from Afghanistan .
February 28 , 2002 Kabul officials announced that Afghan police are creating their first anti - narcotics units with the help of the United Nations due to concern that the country could again become a major producer of opium .
February 28 , 2002 Qanooni stated in talks with Russian Interior Minister Boris Gryzlov that Afghanistan 's main task is to prevent future drugs production .
Qanooni outlined a three - stage plan of action --
Afghan authorities will seek to ban poppy harvesting .
Afghan authorities will strengthen the borders around Afghanistan .
Afghan authorities will cooperate with the security forces of neighboring states .
Afghanistan is thought to be responsible for 75 percent of the world 's opium and 80 percent of the heroin traded illegally in Europe .
Approximately 11000 Russian guards patrol the 1200 - kilometre ( 750 - mile ) border between Russia and Afghanistan under a 1992 agreement signed by Moscow and Dushanbe .
The Northern Alliance opposes the Taliban but tolerated the harvest of poppy in territory it controlled .
Afghanistan 's interim government has been in power for 2 months .

South Korea 's defense ministry under attack in parliament over allegations it is favoring U.S. company Boeing for multi - billion - dollar fighter project .
Newspaper reports reveal that French - made plane was rated higher in air force evaluations and that the Government is instead responding to political pressure from the U.S. and Boeing .
South Korea 's Defense Ministry came under attack in Parliament on 04 March 2002 over allegations that it is favoring U.S. company Boeing for a multi - billion - dollar fighter project .
Ruling and opposition lawmakers criticized the Ministry as newspapers reported that the French - made fighter Rafale had scored the highest marks of any of the 4 contenders in field tests performed by South Korean Air Force evaluators .
The 3.2 billion U.S. dollar project to buy 40 fighters will be one of the most important international military contracts awarded this year but it has encountered multiple obstacles .
Award of the contract was temporarily suspended in February 2002 after the prices offered by 4 bidders were judged too high .
South Korea 's defense ministry promised to conclude its first - stage appraisal by the end of March 2002 .
There has also been much newspaper speculation that the South Korean government might yield to U.S. pressure to buy Boeing 's aged F - 15 k.
Speculation grew in February 2002 when Defense Minister Kim Dong - Shin stressed that South Korea should consider security ties with the United States in the project .
The other competing planes are the Dassault firm 's Rafale , the Eurofighter Consortium 's typhoon 2000 and the Russian Su - 32 made by Sukhoi .
Dassault is seeking its first foreign order for the Rafale .
Kang Chang - Sung of the opposition Grand National Party expressed doubt of the fairness of the evaluation methods stating that his party suspects that the Defense Ministry has political reasons to select the F - 15 k.
The ruling Millennium Democratic Party also accused the Ministry of favoring the F - 15 k despite the defense chief 's insistence that there was no favoritism toward Boeing .
Kim stated --
There has been no pressure from the United States .
There would be an investigation into how classified documents had been leaked .
The Defense Ministry was further pressured by numerous newspaper reports of the Air Force 's evaluation of the Rafale as excellent in all categories .
Newspapers stated that the F - 15 k was rated excellent in reliability and support combat capability but met only 30 percent of core technology requirements .
Newspapers stated that the Eurofighter was rated excellent in general function and reliability categories but the Rafale also earned the excellent rating for its weapons and electronic warfare capability .
The Su - 35 placed fourth with ratings of ordinary in all five categories .
Rafale reportedly offered more generous terms for technology transfer and subcontracts for South Korea 's aerospace industry .
The Ministry stated that the air force was just 1 of 4 evaluations .
Some analysts have stated that the study method is biased toward Boeing noting that the evaluation was revised in February 2002 to ensure that all 4 bidders would receive an automatic 60 points for technology transfer .
The English - language Korea Herald newspaper stated that this revision gives an advantage to Boeing which has been reluctant to transfer core technology .
The Korea Herald stated that when evaluators were conducting their first - stage reports the ministry ordered them to give each bidder grades within a range of 60 to 100 points instead of 0 to 100 points .
The Korea Herald stated that critics say Boeing would benefit most from the points minimum because it would gain fewer points than Dassault in terms of technology transfer and subcontracts .

A senior South Korean minister on Friday warned that there could be a new crisis this year over inspections of the rival North 's nuclear program .
Senior South Korean minister Jeong Se - hyun on 020329 warned that tensions could rise because North Korea wants inspections of its nuclear facilities delayed .
Unification Minister Jeong is the South Korean government 's chief policymaker for relations with North Korea .
Jeong said in a lecture on South Korea and US relations with North Korea that there was some talk in the United States that the nuclear inspection in North Korea should be carried out in 020800 .
North Korea 's suggestion is that the inspection should be delayed until 050000 .
Jeong said that a crisis could come in 020800 on the Korean peninsula if this issue becomes an international point of contention .
Following Jeong 's comments another senior government official sought to play down Jeong 's remarks about the looming troubles .
The unnamed official told the Yonhap national news agency that talk of pressing for IAEA inspections in 020800 had come only from private researchers in the United States .
The official said it was speculation that the North Korean government thinks the inspections should be delayed until 050000 .
Top South Korean envoy Lim Won - dong intends to raise international concerns about the North 's nuclear and missile programs when he goes to Pyongyang 020403 .
Lim is a special advisor to President Kim Dae - jung on national security and foreign affairs .
Lim has also warned of a looming nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula .
Military officials said Lim intimated the problems could be as serious as a 940000 nuclear standoff over North Korea 's suspected nuclear weapons development that came close to conflict .
The North Korean government agreed to freeze the North Korean nuclear program under an accord with a US - led international consortium .
The consortium is to build 2 light water nuclear reactors that produce less weapons grade fuel than North Korea 's old graphite reactors and provide substitute fuel until they are built .
The original 030000 target date for completion has been put back at least 5 years because of major political and construction delays .
The 940000 Accord stipulated that the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) must be allowed to inspect North Korea 's old facilities to see if plutonium has been processed before the core facilities of the new reactors are installed .

The number of heroin addicts in Tajikistan has vastly increased over the past five years due to drug trafficking between Afghanistan and Russia and Europe .
The number of heroin addicts in Tajikistan has vastly increased over the past five years due to drug trafficking between Afghanistan and Europe .
The majority of the heroin is grown in neighboring Afghanistan .
Afghanistan is the world 's top opium producer .
Tajikistan shares a 1300 - kilometer ( 800 - mile ) border with Afghanistan and has become a transit point for heroin being trafficked into Russia and Europe .
In 2001 the Russian army and Tajik police confiscated nearly 9 tons of drugs and arrested more than 2000 people .
The Russian army guards Tajikistan 's border with Afghanistan .
The majority of Tajikistan 's heroin addicts live in cities and are aged between 18 and 25 .
75 percent of Tajikistan 's population lives in rural areas , where heroin addicts are frequently ostracized .
Head of a public drug clinic in Dushanbe , Tajikistan Andrei Onishchenko , stated --
There are 5000 heroin addicts officially registered in Tajikistan , compared with 57 in 1997 .
The actual figure is seven times greater than the official number .
The low cost and availability of heroin are among the causes of the addiction problem .
One dose of heroin costs less than a dollar in Tajikistan , which is less than the price of a bottle of the local vodka .
an addict who has been using heroin for 2 years needs to use 3 grams of heroin every 24 hours .
3 grams of heroin costs 70 somonis or 30 dollars .
an addict is willing to commit any crime to pay for heroin .
Afghan heroin is the strongest in the world because it is made from poppies cultivated at high altitudes and therefore subjected to high doses of ultra - violet light .
A person who takes a daily dose of Afghan heroin has a life expectancy of between 5 and 7 years and many commit suicide before that .
The Tajik State pays 25 dirams ( a few cents ) per day for every person in the rehabilitation clinics .
The percentage of relapses is very high due to the lack of followup treatment and unemployment among young people .
Head of a Tajik government agency that fights drug trafficking Avaz yuldachev stated that heroin users are ill and need treatment .
Anvar , a 14 - year - old boy from Dushanbe , used heroin for three years before being hospitalized in Onishchenko 's drug clinic .
Anvar said --
He sniffed a white substance he found in his backyard and was unable to stop .
He stopped going to school .
He stole from the local market to get money for more heroin .
Drug traffickers face the death penalty under Tajik law .
Tajikistan has 6.2 million inhabitants .

AFP , members of international and local press , and United Nations representatives and diplomats witnessed Myanmar destroy illicit drugs the authorities captured .
Min said Myanmar would be one of the richest countries in the region if they were as corrupt as outsiders claimed .
Hla Min stated that illicit drugs worth some 50 billion dollars have been destroyed by authorities since 1974 .
Min said it was enough to pay Myanmar 's national debt ten times over .
Drug - burning ceremonies are regular events in Myanmar .
Critics argue that it does not reflect the massive drug industry in the country .
Resident Representative of the UN 's Drug Control Program ( UNDCP ) Jean - Luc Lemahieu said this one is different .
Almost 102 tons of poppy seeds were burnt in the capital of Myanmar 's northern Shan state at this ceremony .
The ceremony also included 249 kilograms of opium , 102 kilograms of morphine powder , three kilograms of solid morphine and various precursor chemicals .
Lemahieu said that this ceremony had less processed opium and heroin than opium seeds .
It made it more symbolic and indicated the willingness of those directly involved to eliminate the opium .
The destruction forms part of the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control 's project new destiny .
It aims to prevent poppy cultivation by distributing seeds for substitution crops .
Farmers have been asked to grow seven kinds of alternative crops across 21,969 acres ( 8,891 hectares ) of land instead of opium .
Global narcotics authorities declared Myanmar the world 's largest producer of opium in 2001 .
They accounted for as much as 60 percent of global supply .
Myanmar beat Afghanistan because the Taliban militia 's enforced ban on opium poppies decreased Afghan production by 90 percent .
Critics said the Myanmar regime overlooks much of the production and trafficking in drugs by ethnic insurgent groups .
In particular the largest armed drug militia in the world the United Wa State Army .
Myanmar 's Home Minister Colonel Tin Hlaing said the success of project new destiny is evidenced by the tons of poppy seeds that have been turned in rather than seized .
Hlaing stated his confidence in the drug scourge that threatens the world will not find a place in Myanmar if the local population is committed to this sort of cooperation .
Lauk Kai is one of the regime 's showpieces for its previous crop substitution programs .
It has expanses of rubber trees , fruit orchards and paddy where poppies used to thrive .
The poppies yielded the raw ingredient for heroin .
Lauk Kai is located in the infamous Golden Triangle .
Reformed drug lord and leader of the Kokang phone Kyar Shin pledged commitment to the government program .
The Kokang comprise the majority of the population in Myanmar .
Phone Kyar Shin predicts that starting today there will be no destruction ceremony in the future because no more poppy will be grown .
Phone Kyar Shin said this at another ceremony that destroyed more than 12 tons of poppy seed .
Phone Kyar Shin appealed for help from the international community .
The international community is reluctant to give help .
Phone Kyar Shin requested the distinguished guests to understand Myanmar 's situation more and give practical advice and support .
UNDCP 's Lemahieu when asked by AFP what impact project New Destiny had on the international community hoped it would have a positive impact and that some additional funds would come forward .
Lemahieu said so much depends on the political situation in this country .
There is hope for further political change following the May 6 release of pro - democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from 19 months house arrest .
The regime seeks the United States approval for the project .
Its global announcement comes via the regime 's newly - appointed public relations firm in Washington .

Ecological organization Greenpeace stated on June 21 , 2002 that Russia helped Iran to develop nuclear weapons by building Iran 's Bushehr atomic power station .
The Russian branch of Greenpeace distributed a report at a press conference of Russia 's atomic energy ministry .
The ministry conceded that the Russo - Iranian accord on the plant 's construction does not require the repatriation of the nuclear fuel .
The report stated that the recycling of nuclear fuel from Bushehr is not mentioned in the accord between the Russian and Iranian governments on the construction of the plant .
Greenpeace member Vladimir Chuprov said the ministry had practically admitted that Iran will not return to Russia the spent nuclear fuel from the power station and Russia 's only use for Iran is to equip itself with nuclear weapons .
The atomic energy ministry confirmed the report 's existence and strongly denied Greenpeace 's accusations .
Ministry spokesman Nikolai Shingarev told AFP that Russia would only supply nuclear fuel to Iran on condition that it be returned to Russia after its use .
Shingarev said Russia is currently in negotiations with Iran .
This issue will be settled before the power station comes into operation .
Shingarev said the accord on Bushehr was signed before Russia passed a law permitting the import of nuclear waste last year .
This explains why the accord makes no mention of the return of the fuel .
Shingarev said it is very difficult to make a nuclear weapon from the plutonium in this fuel .
The United States and Israel fear that the Russian - Iranian nuclear cooperation could enable Tehran to acquire the technology needed to build nuclear weapons .
Russia dismisses this accusation .
Iran ordered the power station in 1994 at a cost of nearly 800 million dollars ( 860 million euros ) from Russia .
Iran has said the plant is being built only for civilian energy purposes and allows regular inspections of Bushehr by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Experts say Bushehr could in theory become operational as early as September 2003 .
Currently it is equipped with a single reactor .
German group Siemens pulled out of the long - standing project at the request of the German government after Iran 's 1979 Islamic Revolution .
US President George W. Bush raised the US 's concerns about Russian nuclear cooperation with Iran at the summit in Moscow last month between Bush and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin .

Malaysia proposes expansion of anti - terrorism pact with Indonesia and the Philippines to entire ASEAN .
Terrorism is expanding across Southeast Asia .
The Malaysian Government proposes the expansion of an anti - terrorism pact with Indonesia and the Philippines to encompass the remainder of Southeast Asia .
Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar stated that other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) will be encouraged to accede to the pact at talks next week with ASEAN foreign ministers in Brunei .
Syed Hamid stated that Thailand , Laos and Singapore had expressed interest in joining the pact .
Malaysian defense analyst dzirhan mahadzir stated --
Cooperation by poorer countries may be stymied by financial constraints and a perception that terrorism does not directly affect these countries .
An ASEAN pact is beneficial in the long - term but will be difficult to implement because national security issues and interstate rivalry may make some of ASEAN 's 10 members wary to divulge information .
ASEAN must agree on a definition of terrorism to identify the common enemy .
20020500 senior ASEAN members Malaysia , Indonesia and the Philippines signed an anti - terror security pact intended to initiate the eradication of terrorism from the region .
The 3 countries share sea borders frequently used by pirates and criminals in evading pursuing troops .
The pact includes plans to trace and freeze terror funds and exchange information to curb cross - border piracy , drug trafficking , illegal entry and illegal trafficking of women and children .
Syed Hamid stated that after 20010911 countries should exchange information that may affect transnational crime such as funds of terrorists that may be kept in other countries or third party information to combat the greater threat of international terrorism .
Mushahid Ali of the Singapore - based Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies stated --
The trilateral pact between Malaysia , Indonesia and the Philippines constituted a constructive first step .
Indonesia and other ASEAN members must more proactively monitor terrorist activities and establish a concrete mechanism among national agencies for the protracted conflict .
20020500 ASEAN security ministers at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur failed to agree on a definition of terrorism but agreed to increase cooperation among State enforcement agencies and endorsed the use of detention without trial for suspected militants in Malaysia and Singapore .
Objections were raised concerning Malaysia 's proposal to include State terrorism in the definition .
Dzirhan stated --
The agreement among Malaysia , Indonesia and the Philippines may have been aimed at ingratiating the countries to the US rather than combating terrorism .
Since the pact was signed no progress has occurred .
The creation of a formalized security structure in combating terror will be decelerated by the ASEAN 's model of acting on consensus .
Officials stated that after the meeting in Brunei 20020728-20020801 ASEAN and its major western trading partners are expected to demand freezing of terror funds and stronger counter - terrorism cooperation .
Dozens of suspected terrorists allegedly linked to al-Qaeda in Malaysia , Singapore and the Philippines have revealed the existence of a regional Islamic militant group called the Jemaah Islamiyah , which also operates in Indonesia .
Southeast Asia is now suspected as a potential new haven for al-Qaeda operatives escaping US and allied attacks in Afghanistan and elsewhere .

Atomic Energy Agency director States it would be difficult for Iraq to conceal a nuclear weapons program if international inspectors were allowed to return .
Inspectors would perform various tests , visits , and interviews and their presence alone in the country would be a deterrent .
On 18 October 2002 International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) director Mohamed ElBaradei stated it is unlikely that Iraq could conceal a nuclear weapons program if it allowed international inspectors to return .
ElBaradei stated that once inspectors were working in Iraq their presence alone would be a deterrent to developing nuclear weapons .
ElBaradei stated to reporters at his headquarters in Vienna --
It is difficult to conceal a nuclear program if thorough inspections are performed because nuclear products always have a signature .
Traces are always visible if highly enriched uranium or plutonium were used .
ElBaradei stated that inspectors would perform environmental sampling , gamma radiation surveys from helicopters , internal periodic visits to all capable sites and interviews with all former nuclear scientists to confirm that they are not working in the nuclear program .
ElBaradei stated that the IAEA could not give a 100 percent guarantee but that the presence of inspectors would be a good deterrent and a good mechanism for detection .
ElBaradei stated --
It is necessary to control imports to Iraq because of the risk that Iraq is receiving nuclear material from outside the country .
There must be physical protection of all nuclear material particularly in the former Soviet Union .
There must be strong unanimous support by the UN Security Council to force Iraq to comply with IAEA inspection .
The IAEA must be given as much intelligence information as possible to guide inspectors to anything that should be inspected or to any item hidden from inspectors .
The Security Council has been meeting in open session to discuss the Iraq issue before the vote on conditions under which UN weapons inspectors will return to Baghdad to verify Iraqi assertions that it does not possess nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .
UN weapons inspectors departed Baghdad in 1998 .

Bangladesh opposition claims a crime crackdown being carried out by the army is becoming political witchhunt , and human rights groups claim fundamental rights are being violated .
Bangladesh 's main opposition leader Sheikh Hasina Wajed said 021102 that an army crackdown on crime was turning into a political witchhunt and targeting her Awami League party .
Troops were ordered into the streets more than 2 weeks ago to eliminate rampant crime but human rights groups claim fundamental rights are being trampled .
Newspapers and rights groups put the toll of those who have died in police and military custody at 16 .
Officials say more than 3400 people have been taken into custody since the crackdown began 021017 .
The government has confirmed the deaths of 12 people due to heart attacks .
Relatives allege some suspects have been tortured in custody .
The US government and London - based Amnesty International have also expressed concern about the custodial deaths .
Amnesty urged a prompt and fair investigation by an independent body into the deaths .
Sheikh Hasina told reporters at the airport on her return from a private trip to the United States and Europe that initially it appeared to be a neutral anti - crime drive and the opposition Awami League party welcomed it .
Hasina said the crackdown is gradually turning into one to eliminate the Opposition .
Hasina wants the military to arrest real criminals and not violate Bangladesh 's constitution and human rights because of concern about such violations in the name of anti - crime drive .
Sheikh Hasina said the military has to operate within the laws of the land as no one is above the law .
Police said the army hadon 021101 arrested former state minister and Awami League lawmaker talukder Abdul khaleque in southwestern Khulna city soon after he spoke at a news conference against the deployment .
The Daily Star newspaper reported that an imam and a local leader of fundamentalist group Jamaat - e - Islami were also arrested on 021101 in Khulna .
Former minister and Awami League lawmaker Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and Sheikh Hasina 's Political Secretary ex - minister Saber Hossain Chowdhury were arrested 021000 along with independent MP Hemayet Ullah aurango .
Selim , Chowdhury and aurango are being detained under the strict 740000 Special Powers Act allowing detention for 120 days without charge .
Sheikh Hasina questioned how 3 of the Awami League party 's ex - ministers could be terrorists .
Hasina was apparently unaware of the claims of the arrest of the Jamaat leader when adding that it is an open secret that the Jamaat - e - Islami and the Jamaat - e - Islami student wing have weapons and wondering why none of the Jamaat - e - Islami has been arrested so far .
Hasina said the Awami League party would raise the issue when parliament reconvenes 021114 .
Bangladesh 's Prime Minister Khaleda Zia 's Islamist - allied government includes 2 cabinet ministers from the Jamaat .
Zia 's administration denies the drive is politically biased and stresses that activists from ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) have also been detained .
A young BNP activist died 021101 in a hospital after being interrogated by the army .
Police said the activist was wanted in a number of cases .

The Russian government hailed cooperation of Arab countries in fighting terrorism and said not one Arab state backed the Chechen separatists who are accused of waging a terrorist campaign .
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) Secretary General Abdel Rahman al-Attiya held talks on 021104 .
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Yakovenko said afterward that not a single Arab country supports rebels in Chechnya .
Yakovenko said the Russian Government finds it inadmissible to link individual States or religions with terrorism or extremism and is grateful to those Arab states which are trying to cooperate with Russian law enforcement agencies to cut channels for funding terrorist organizations .
The Russian government has consistently sought to portray its campaign against a separatist insurgency in Chechnya as part of the global war on terrorism and says that rebel groups are receiving backing from the terrorist Al-Qaeda network and from shadowy Islamic radical groups based in countries such as Saudi Arabia .
A senior Kremlin official said last week that the Russian Government might ask the GCC State Qatar to extradite Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev .
Yandarbiyev is a former Chechen Vice - President and aide to rebel president Aslan Maskhadov .
The Russian government accuses Yandarbiyev of involvement in the 041000 hostage - taking in a Moscow theater .
Russian government spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Qatar 's response would demonstrate the extent of that country 's willingness to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism .
Yakovenko said that stronger ties between Russia and the GCC States could play a special role in combating international terrorism .
Ivanov said al-Attiya 's visit will contribute to increased cooperation between the Russian government and the six Arab monarchies of the Gulf region .
Ivanov said the Russian government wanted to strengthen its ties with the Gulf countries and that these ties have begun to strengthen recently .
Ivanovalso said the Russian government would like to develop them further and particularly in areas of mutual interest .
The Russian government has traditionally been close to the Arab side in the Middle East conflict and has spoken strongly against US armed intervention against Iraq in the stand - off over disarmament .
Yakovenko said that Al-Attiya 's talks with Russian government officials 021104 and 021105 were likely to focus on oil issues and noted that both the Russian government and the Gulf countries are interested in stable world prices .
Yakovenko said the main emphasis of the talks will be on Russia 's possible involvement in the implementation of regional projects run by the Council and said that there will be particular emphasis on finding peaceful , political and diplomatic ways to settle the Iraqi issue .
Al-Attiya also plans to hold talks with economic ministers and senior officials such as the head of the Chamber of Commerce Yevgeny Primakov and the Chairman of the Russian employers ' association Arkady Volsky .

Sheni stated that Africa will find it difficult to influence global research priorities in its favor without a forum .
The continent lacks resources .
Sheni attended a four - day meeting to discuss global health at Arusha in northern Tanzania .
Sheni addressed more than 700 public health specialists from 100 countries .
Sheni told delegates at the Global Forum for Health Research 's annual meeting that less than 10 percent of the global health research budget of 70 billion dollars went to Africa .
Africa has 90 percent of the global diseases .
Sheni said the formation of the Asian and Pacific Health Research Forum and the Latin American Health Research Forum are steps in the right direction .
Global Forum for Health Research Chairman Richard Feachem said it was unfair for poor countries to be allocated meager sums of research funding .
Feachem said the majority of the poor are getting little health research funding compared to the wealthy few .
The Global Forum for Health Research is an independent , international foundation funded by the Rockefeller Foundation , the World Health Organization , the World Bank and the Governments of Canada , Denmark , Netherlands , Norway , Sweden and Switzerland .

New U.S. study claims that one - tenth of Internet 's sites are blocked by the Chinese Government authorities using updated Filtering technology .
A wide range of sites including a very high percentage of news sites and keywords were found to be blocked .
A U.S. study released on 03 December 2002 states that one - tenth of the Internet 's sites may be blocked by Chinese authorities as part of efforts to prevent access to information on dissidents , Taiwan , Tibet and other subjects .
The study was conducted by Harvard University 's berkman Center for Internet and society .
The study found that more than 50000 of the approximately 200000 websites tested were inaccessible from at least 1 point in China on at least 1 occasion .
Using a more narrow definition of blocked site the study concluded that 18931 websites were being blocked to Chinese web users .
Harvard researcher and co - author of the report Ben Edelman stated that it is likely that similar percentages apply to the Internet as a whole .
Edelman told AFP that it is highly likely that approximately one - tenth of the Internet is filtered by or recently has been filtered by China .
Edelman stated that there are many different ways to measure this effect and therefore hesitated to specify any single proportion .
The latest study was broader than prior surveys and gives perspective to disparate reports about websites that are filtered or blocked by China .
In the report it is concluded that --
China blocks a range of web content beyond that which is sexually explicit .
1000s of sites providing information about news , health , education , and entertainment were blocked .
Approximately 3284 sites from Taiwan were blocked .
The blocked sites also included those of U.S. news organizations including ABC News and CBS News , the Alta Vista search engine , and a number of U.S. universities .
The researchers found that 100 percent of the top 10 sites with keywords Tibet , Taiwan China , or equality were blocked .
A large number of other sites with keywords such as freedom , democracy and HIV were also blocked .
The BBC news site was consistently unavailable .
Sites for CNN , Time magazine , U.S. - based public broadcasting system , the Miami Herald , and the Philadelphia Inquirer were also often blocked .
The report found that 42 of google 's top 100 results for news were blocked .
Religious sites blocked in China included the Asian American Baptist Church , The atheist network , the Catholic Civil Rights League , Feng Shui , the Jewish Federation of Winnipeg , and the Denver Zen center .
China has an estimated 45 million Internet users .
China has been widely criticized in the West for blocking websites and for imprisoning people for viewing banned sites or using the Internet for anti - government activities .
The Chinese government is believed to routinely block a large number of foreign - based sites primarily those featuring dissident views or banned groups such as the Falungong spiritual organization but also certain foreign news sites and pages showing pornography .
A recent report by the U.S. - based Rand Corporation think tank found that the Chinese government now uses more technology to filter out objectionable content rather than relying solely on surveillance of users and seizure of equipment as it did in the past .
The rand report released earlier in 2002 found that Chinese authorities now appear to have more effective technology for filtering out undesirable content .

A laboratory chief from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said on December 10 , 2002 that the UN 's nuclear agency could detect even infinitesimal amounts of radiation from weapons programs if they exist in samples from Iraq .
A laboratory chief from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said on December 10 , 2002 that the UN 's nuclear agency could detect infinitesimal amounts of radiation from weapons programs if they exist in samples from Iraq .
David Donohue spoke at the IAEA laboratory in Seibersdorf on the southwest outskirts of Vienna .
Donohue said the equipment can detect particles down to the picogram ( a millionth of a millionth of a gram ) .
The first samples from Iraq are due to arrive to the laboratory this week .
IAEA and other UN inspectors have been taking soil , water and air samples since November 27 , 2001 at Iraqi sites suspected of being used for programs to make weapons of mass destruction .
Donohue said samples will be sent for corroboration to labs in France , the US , the UK ( Britain ) , Japan and Russia if IAEA finds any traces of radiation from enriched uranium or plutonium , or any chemical and biological agents .
Donohue said it is very difficult to manipulate radioactive isotopes without leaving a trail .
A trail will be left even if it 's only ultra - traces .
The IAEA is the UN agency charged with monitoring nuclear activity .
The UN Monitoring , Verification and Inspection Commission ( UNMOVIC ) tests for chemical , biological and ballistic missile programs .
UNMOVIC is based in New York .

South Korea urges North Korea to return nuclear reactor to UN surveillance .
North Korea had violated 1994 shut down by disabling surveillance devices .
20021222 South Korea urged North Korea to return the Yongbyon nuclear reactor to UN surveillance in order to deescalate the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula .
20021221 the UN International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) stated that North Korea had disabled IAEA surveillance devices by breaking seals on IAEA equipment and blocking surveillance cameras at the country 's 5 megawatt nuclear reactor .
20021221 IAEA Director General General Mohammed ElBaradei expressed regret over North Korea 's actions .
A South Korean Foreign Ministry official stated --
The development is regrettable and will increase tension over North Korea 's nuclear weapons program .
Japan and the United States should act jointly with South Korea .
The IAEA stated that ElBaradei warned the government of North Korea not to take further action that would prevent the IAEA from monitoring compliance with the 1994 accord with the United States shutting down the reactor .
20041212 North Korea stated that the country 's plutonium - producing nuclear program would recommence in order to produce energy due to a global embargo on oil shipments .
In 1994 the reactor was frozen under an accord in exchange for 500000 tons of fuel oil annually from the United States .
The accord additionally formed a consortium to build 2 light - water reactors .
International experts stated that the Yongbyon reactor was used to produce weapons - grade plutonium .
After the 1994 closing approximately 8000 spent fuel rods from the reactor were sealed in metal casings in cooling ponds .
20041000 the United States revealed that North Korea had admitted to implementing a nuclear program based on enriched uranium , a material for nuclear weapons .

North Korea removed UN seals at a laboratory suspected of being used to produce weapons - grade material .
This activity further escalates tension in the Korean Peninsula 's nuclear crisis and ignores international condemnation .
A source close to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said late on 021223 the North had started stripping the UN nuclear regulation group 's seals and monitoring equipment from the laboratory at Yongbyon .
The lab is suspected of having reprocessed fuel rods for weapons - grade plutonium before its activities were frozen under a 940000 arms control deal with the United Sates .
The source is fully informed of IAEA activities in North Korea and said the North Koreans are cutting the seals of the nuclear fuel reprocessing laboratory and could complete it possibly by 021224 .
The move followed similar actions 021221-021222 at the Yongbyon nuclear facility during which the North Korean government took control of 1000s of spent fuel rods that could be used to make nuclear weapons .
The nuclear crisis dominated the first meeting between South Korean President Kim Dae - Jung and President - elect Roh Moo - hyun earlier 021223 .
Kim and Roh were meeting for the first time since Roh 's election last week and the meeting was supposed to focus on smoothing over the 030225 transfer of power between the outgoing and incoming leaders .
The 90 - minute talks instead centered on the North Korean government 's latest standoff with the international community .
President Kim 's spokeswoman Park Sun - sook said that Kim and Roh 's discussion was pinned down on international relations which focused on North Korea 's nuclear issue .
The South Korean government 's frustration with the North Korean government was evident in a foreign ministry statement which urged the North Korean government to restore the seals and disabled monitoring cameras on the rods .
The statement said that the North Korean government took further actions to unfreeze its nuclear activities despite repeated warnings from the South Korean government and the international community and was raising regional tension and amplifying international concerns over nuclear proliferation .
The United States responded to that development with swift condemnation .
US State Department spokesman Louis Fintor said the over 8000 spent fuel rods are of particular concern because they can be reprocessed to recover plutonium for nuclear weapons .
US Senator Richard Lugar said the North Korean government was creating a very dangerous situation , initially for South Korea and for Japan but ultimately for the United States .
Lugar will head the Senate 's Foreign Relations Committee in 030000 .
The United States has been stepping up international pressure on the North Korean government since 021222 .
Deputy US Ambassador Evans Revere met South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Tai - sik in Seoul on 021223 to discuss countermeasures to be taken against the North Korean government following the US and South Korean foreign ministers ' urgent talks over the phone .
Japanese Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi also expressed the widespread international alarm about the North Korean government 's regrettable latest move .
Analysts have said North Koreans could extract some 25 kilograms ( 55 pounds ) of weapons - grade plutonium for at least 3 nuclear weapons from the irradiated rods .
The North Korean government said it unfroze its nuclear facilities because it was in a desperate energy crisis aggravated by the suspension of fuel oil shipments .
The US government said the spent plutonium has nothing to do with power generation .
The United States and North Korea came close to war over the North Korean government 's plutonium program in the early 1990s .
The confrontation was defused when the US and North Korean Governments signed the 940000 agreed framework .
That accord has been undermined since the North Korean government admitted in 021000 to running a new , secret and separate program based on enriched uranium .
The US government cut its fuel aid to the North Korea in retaliation .

North Korea was criticized on December 26 , 2002 for moving to restart its long - dormant nuclear program .
The UN atomic agency said such moves were tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship .
North Korea was criticized on December 26 , 2002 for moving to restart its long - dormant nuclear program .
The UN atomic agency said such moves were tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship .
South Korean President Kim Dae Jung told officials that North Korea 's shifting of unspent fuel rods into a building housing a reactor capable of producing weapons - grade plutonium aggravated an already - tense situation .
Kim Dae Jung and officials assembled at an urgent national security meeting .
Kim Dae Jung said that North Korea moved to restart frozen nuclear facilities despite the international community 's efforts for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue .
This further aggravated the situation .
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said the shift of the rods was proactive .
Plutonium could be extracted for making nuclear warheads within months .
The United States dismissed the action as nuclear blackmail .
There was strong criticism from the United Nations ' International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
Beginning last week IAEA saw its monitoring equipment disabled and seals removed from the nuclear facilities that had been dormant since a 1994 accord with the United States .
IAEA director Mohamed ElBaradei dismissed claims by North Korea 's government that it was only acting in the wake of an energy crisis in North Korea .
ElBaradei said that the reprocessing facility at Yongbyong is irrelevant to North Korea 's ability to produce electricity .
North Korea has no current legitimate peaceful use for plutonium given the status of its nuclear fuel cycle .
ElBaradei said restarting North Korea 's nuclear facilities without appropriate safeguards and towards producing plutonium raises serious non - proliferation concerns is tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship .
The move of 1,000 unspent rods into the reactor building is the latest action taken by the energy - starved North since the apparent collapse of a 1994 accord that froze its nuclear capacity .
The move is confirmed by both the UN agency and the South Korean Foreign Ministry .
The facility has the capacity for 8,000 rods .
All have been stored in a cooling pond at Yongbyon since the United States offered North Korea annual supplies of heavy fuel oil and two new light water nuclear reactors in return for Pyongyang 's agreement to freeze its nuclear operations at Yongbyon .
The eight - year - old deal has fallen apart following US revelations in October 2002 that North Korea had admitted to running a separate nuclear program based on enriched uranium technology in violation of the accord .
North Korea is bankrupt and on the brink of economic collapse .
It has been pushing for negotiations with the United States .
Experts say North Korea needs aid and security guarantees from the United States to ensure its survival .
Throughout the nuclear dispute North Korea has said it is ready to sit down and talk with the United States and even to refreeze its Yongbyon program .
President Kim has been pushing the United States to accept the offer under Kim 's sunshine policy of engagement with the North .
President Kim has criticized the United States for previously sidelining South Korea in handling North Korea and said South Korea should take a leading role .
Kim was critical of the US handling of the stand - off when eight years ago the United States and North Korea drew back from the brink of war over Pyongyang 's plutonium program .
The President has complained that South Korea was sidelined during the entire dispute and ended up paying a multi - billion dollar bill for the light - water reactors .
Kim 's chief security adviser Yim Sung - joon said the President instructed that North Korea should take lead because the North Korean nuclear issue is important to the Korean peninsula .
This was said in a statement after December 26 , 2002 's meeting .
The United States said it would stand up to nuclear blackmail and has ruled out negotiations .
The US pledged not to reward bad behavior .
Experts have joined the IAEA in dismissing the idea that North Korea was relaunching the reactor for energy purposes .
Director General for International institutions at the ministry in Seoul Chun Young - Woo said it would produce at its peak enough for one large office building which is a negligible amount .

Experts warn that North Korea could produce weapons - grade plutonium from spent fuel rods at re - opened nuclear reactor .
Existing rods could produce 3-6 atomic bombs in 6-8 months .
Experts stated that 8000 spent fuel rods reportedly stockpiled by North Korea at a nuclear reactor the country is threatening to re - start could be used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons .
Experts stated that the rods could produce 3-6 atomic bombs in 6-8 months .
The IAEA stated that North Korea additionally moved 1000 fresh rods into the nuclear reactor as well .
The reactor could produce enough spent rods to construct 1 atomic bomb per year if reactivated .
The experimental nuclear plant in Yongbyon is a miniature of electricity - producing nuclear plants in Western countries but operates on the same principles .
The Yongbyon plant produces 5 megawatts .
Plants in France produce 1300 megawatts .
The Yongbyon plant is 100 km north of the North Korean capital Pyongyang .
Nuclear reactor process --
4 meter fuel rods containing uranium oxide are burned to initiate fission -- the nucleus of the uranium atom is split , releasing neutrons that collide with other atoms , creating more neutrons in a chain reaction .
Fission produces immense heat which is applied to water to create steam which drives turbines to generate electricity .
Plutonium and other radioactive byproducts of the process accumulate and decrease the effectiveness of the rods until they are spent after 3-4 years .
Spent rods consisting of highly radioactive plutonium and residual uranium are cooled in pools of water for several years to diminish radioactivity and then the plutonium is then recovered in nitrate form and converted into oxide .
The recovered plutonium can be mixed with uranium for reuse in the reactor or used in making nuclear weapons .
Nuclear experts stated that to make weapons , a high proportion of plutonium 239 ( military grade plutonium , as opposed to the commercial plutonium used in power plants ) must be extracted .

British officials are deeply concerned by a warning from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) concerning North Korea 's opening of the Yongbyon facility and possible nuclear intentions .
A UK Foreign Office spokeswoman said Thursday that the UK government is deeply concerned about the latest revelations in a warning by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) concerning North Korea 's possible nuclear intentions .
The comments came after the IAEA accused the North Korean government of nuclear brinkmanship and said the North Korean government had begun work to reactivate the Yongbyon reactor in breach of a 940000 agreement with the United States Government .
The UK Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said the UK government is in regular contact with international partners about the implications of the latest developments and is committed to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wherever it may occur .
The spokeswoman added that the North Korean government must comply with international obligations and eliminate nuclear weapons .
The IAEA has said the North Korean government had no current legitimate peaceful use for plutonium that could be produced at the newly reopened Yongbyon site that is capable of producing weapons - grade plutonium .
The IAEA said the North Koreans had moved 1000 fresh fuel rods into the Yongbyon reactor building .
Of more concern are the 8000 spent fuel rods at the facility they started unsealing 021215-021221 and the dismantling of IAEA monitoring equipment at the site .
Experts say the spent rods could be used to build 3-6 atomic bombs within 6-8 months .
The United States Government offered supplies of fuel oil and 2 new light water nuclear reactors in return for the North Korean government 's agreement to freeze nuclear operations under the 940000 agreed framework shutting down Yongbyon .
The agreement fell apart following US government revelations in 021000 that the North Korean government had admitted to a separate nuclear program based on enriched uranium technology .
The US government suspended oil shipments to North Korea as punishment .
The North Korean government in turn claimed to be in desperate need of power generation after the oil supplies were cut and began during 021215-021221 to unseal the spent fuel rods at the facility and to dismantle monitoring equipment .

South Korea threatens to cease support following North Korean nuclear re - activation .
President - elect Roh seeks peaceful solution .
20021227 South Korean President - elect Roh Moo - hun stated --
South Korea will cease support if North Korea continues to ignore global concern over the country 's nuclear weapons program .
North Korea should not act further to aggravate the situation .
Inter - Korean exchanges will suffer if tensions among South Koreans escalate due to the actions of North Korea .
South Korea must take initiative in coping with the crisis because the issue directly concerns the Korean people 's survival .
Roh campaigned on a pro - engagement platform and has endorsed President Kim Dae - jung 's softline sunshine policy of engagement with North Korea .
An aide stated that Roh 's incoming Administration has established channels of communication with the North to defuse the crisis and discover North Korea 's intentions .
The US supports the initiative .
Roh takes office in 20030200 .
North Korea is re - activating nuclear operations at Yongbyon after violating a 1994 arms control deal with the United States .
The IAEA stated that North Korea has cut seals and impeded surveillance equipment at 3 facilities at Yongbyon .
Yongbyon is 100 km north of Pyongyang .
The United States urged North Korea to meet obligations under international arms control accords .
US State Department spokeswoman Brenda Greenberg stated that attempts to restarts facilities would compound North Korea 's violations of these international commitments .
20030110 President George W. Bush is to send an envoy to Seoul do discuss defusing the crisis with Roh .
Roh will subsequently send an envoy to Washington .
Roh has advocated a peaceful resolution to the crisis through dialogue and has criticized the US hardline policy as potentially dangerous .
20021226 incoming Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Republican Senator Richard Lugar stated on NBC television that a US attack would be inadvisable because North Korea would likely retaliate with a potentially devastating attack on the Seoul area .
Roh 's aide acknowledged Lugar 's statement .
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer stated that Australia will suspend plans to open an embassy in Pyongyang to avoid appearing to condone North Korea 's nuclear actions .
20021226 IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei stated --
North Korea has moved 1,000 fresh fuel rods into the reactor building at Yongbyon -- which is capable of producing military plutonium -- as a prelude to reactivation .
North Korea has no use for plutonium in its civilian program and thus may be planning military activity .
The IAEA 's board of governors will shortly issue a report on the recent developments .
The Board was originally scheduled to meet 20030106 .

China launches unmanned space craft Shenzhou IV into a preset orbit with the eventual goal of sending astronauts into space .
30 December 2002 at 00:40 am -- China launched space craft Shenzhou IV into a preset orbit .
Shenzhou IV was launched by a Long March II F carrier rocket from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern Gansu province .
Chinese scientists announced Shenzhou IV would conduct experiments on the astronaut flight system and control of Shenzhou IV 's environment and life support system .
A Chinese aerospace official announced Shenzhou IV would return to Inner Mongolia within 7 days .
According to the Xinhua news agency the leading designer of the astronaut system for China 's manned space program commander Su Shuangning stated --
China will soon send astronauts to space .
Shenzhou IV is equipped to carry astronauts .
Chinese astronauts must first receive training in basic theories , professional skills and flight procedures and tasks .
In July 2002 the Pentagon announced --
China could send astronauts into space in 2003 .
China plans to build a reusable space vehicle similar to the US space shuttle .
14 Chinese astronauts have undergone training on Shenzhou space craft .
The Chinese astronauts were selected from thousands of air force pilots .
In 2001 Russia signed a 5 - year space cooperation agreement with China .
The agreement stipulates that Russia provide China with manned space craft technologies and train Chinese astronauts in Russian facilities .
In May 2002 official Chinese media announced that China plans to establish a base on the moon to exploit the Moon 's mineral resources .
Space expert at the French Institute for International Relations in Paris Laurence nardon stated --
US should not view China 's space manned program as a security threat .
China is a member of the ballistic missile club .
China 's space program is less of a world threat than India 's or Israel 's .
Some US researchers believe China is developing weaponization of its space technology .
China may be developing weaponization of its space technology but is not currently able to implement it .
China plans to put humans in space for prestige .
In November 2002 Chinese Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. President Zhang Qingwei stated --
Shenzhou III 's carrier rocket was equipped with a fault - detecting and handling system .
Shenzhou IV is backed by a ground - based search and rescue system and reinforced by other more reliable safety measures than Shenzhou III 's .
Designer of China 's spacecraft system Qi Faren announced --
The functions , indices and data relevant to manned flights tested well on three previous successful launches and landings of Shenzhou spaceships between 1999 and March 2002 .
China established a space program in 1992 .
Shenzhou I launched in November 1999 and returned to earth within one day .
10 January 2001 -- Shenzhou II launched .
Western analysts suspect re - entry failed .
25 March 2002 -- Shenzhou III launched .
The re - entry vehicle successfully returned to Inner Mongolia a week later .
Only the US and former USSR have sent humans into space .
Shenzhou IV is also referred to as Divine Vessel IV .

European Space Agency is finalizing deal with Russian government to allow for Soyuz rockets to be launched from Europe 's space command at Kourou , in French Guiana replacing phased - out Ariane - 4 launchers .
Plans for Soyuz launches have been delayed by funding issues since costly modifications to launch facilities must be made to accommodate the Russian rocket .
The European Space Agency ( ESA ) stated 10 January 2003 that it was finalizing a deal with the Russian government that could allow Soyuz rockets to be launched from Europe 's space command at Kourou , French Guiana .
The deal between the ESA and the Russian Government could be written as early as March 2003 and signed by the Russian government in April 2003 .
The deal would allow for Soyuz missiles to help replace phased - out Ariane - 4 launchers .
Ariane - 4 launchers send payloads up to 2.8 tons into geostationary orbit .
Spacecraft launched from Kourou benefit from the Earth 's full rotational speed on the equator to aid their trajectory into space .
With this extra momentum , the spacecraft require less fuel .
Plans for the Soyuz launches have been delayed by funding issues since modifications to be made to launch facilities in order to accommodate the Russian rocket are predicted to cost between 250 and 300 million euro .
The Russian space program has experienced funding problems and was unwilling to contribute one third of the bill as ESA had requested .
In November 2002 the Government of France proposed to fund the Russian Government 's share with a loan to be paid back by profits from the launches .
The ESA stated that no financial divisions have been decided yet .
France joined Russia in creating a joint company Starsem in 1996 to commercialize and market the Soyuz launches from Russia 's Baikonur Space Center in Kazakhstan .
Soyuz missiles used to send satellites and cosmonauts into space are the most used type of spacecraft .
Soyuz missiles have over 1700 launches since first launching the Sputnik satellite into orbit in 1957 .

Japan demands that North Korea annul the 20030110 decision to withdraw from the nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
Japan will collaborate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and countries including Russia to ensure North Korea 's reversal .
Koizumi condemns and is concerned by North Korea 's decision .
20030110 Koizumi held a day - long summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin .
Koizumi stated that Koizumi and Putin held identical views on the North Korean crisis .
Late 20030110 a Japanese spokesman stated to Interfax news that Koizumi encouraged Putin to employ the Russian government 's influence on North Korean leadership in pursuing a reversal .
Putin consented to Koizumi 's request and stated that dialogue with North Korean leader Kim Jong - Il was possible .
Koizumi stated that Russia , Japan , and the international community would benefit from improved bilateral relations if Russia and Japan could overcome previous disputes .
In 1945 the Soviet Union seized 4 Southern Kuril Islands still claimed by Japan .
Koizumi stated --
Japan will continue to assist Russia in dismantling weapons of mass destruction including decommissioned nuclear submarines for which Japan will allocate over 200 million dollars .
The weapons should be neutralized immediately in the interest of global security .
Japan will contribute 100 million dollars to the processing of weapons - grade plutonium to prevent appropriation by terrorists .
Japan has contributed 56 million dollars to scientific projects and will continue to cooperate with Russia .
Russia has previously refused to pressure North Korea over defense policy .
Analysts believe that Russia has limited authority to do so .
Koizumi visited the grave of Japanese World War II prisoners in a cemetery at the donskoi monastery in Moscow .
Koizumi will visit the Far Eastern city of Khabarovsk late 20030111 and return to Tokyo 20030112 .

An Indian information technology expert disproved the phobia of cyber attacks and said the threat was overstated .
Director of the Indian Institute of Information Technology S. Sadagopan said the cyber attack is similar to the Y 2K myth ; although these things could happen , they will not happen .
Y 2K was a computer malfunction expected to occur when 1999 changed to 2000 but it did not inflict widespread damage .
Sadagopan addressed delegates at a conference on information security .
Sadagopan stated that these things happen with all technology if history is reviewed and that imaginative people can cause extraordinary problems even with primitive technology .
Sadagopan said the G 8 nations have lost 43 billion dollars due to cyber crime .
The G 8 nations are comprised of France , Britain , Canada , Germany , Italy , Japan , Russia and the United States .
Sadagopan said most people have an alarmist view of such attacks .
The attacks range from viruses , flame - mail ( abusive e-mail ) , stone throwing ( disfiguring a home page ) to cyber squatters and scripts for breaking into Internet sites .
Sadagopan stated that many sensitive installations such as nuclear and power plants , and missiles have an Internet protocol address and that once someone hacks into the sites one can trip the power lines or lead planes and missiles to their choice destinations .
Sadagopan added that this type of hacking is possible , but there is no need to panic .
Sadagopan said it needs to be recognized and while we should be sensitive about such threats it should not be sensationalized rather a pragmatic approach should be taken .
The U.S. State Department said in May 2002 that a computer Hacker had infiltrated its e-mail system .
The Hacker sent a potentially damaging virus to more than 20000 people who receive travel warnings electronically .
A 50 - line code of the love bug virus affects more than 2.8 million files monthly .
Hackers have sent love letter e-mail to all chosen Heads of States from adolfahitler.com .
Pentagon sites had denial of service for more than three hours .
India 's premier nuclear research center Bhabha Atomic resarch center sites were disfigured .
Sadagopan stated that a section of technologists think cyber soldiers , cyber policemen and cyber insurance is needed .
Sadagopan said the threat is overstated and that it is like any other threat , like a foreigner driving on Bangalore roads .
The threat needs to be accepted and then education is the next step .
Sadagopan said it needs to be started today .
It cannot be postponed .

Pakistan authorities announce upgrades of security of nuclear facilities and employees after press reports alleging leaks of its its nuclear technology .
Pakistan on 030122 announced upgrades to the security of nuclear facilities and employees after a series of press reports alleging leaks of nuclear technology to North Korea and possibly Iran and Iraq .
The Los Angeles Times , New York Times and Japanese media have carried several reports quoting unnamed US officials saying that Pakistani scientists or military officers had sold the North Korean government uranium - enrichment technology for the nuclear program .
Pakistan 's government has angrily rejected the reports as malicious and insisted that nuclear technology had never been sold or leaked .
The military statement said Pakistan 's has a long - standing capability for achieving the highest levels of safety and security which is adequate and fail - safe .
The Pakistani government 's announcement came after President Pervez Musharraf chaired a meeting of the Development Control Committee of the National Command Authority ( NCA ) to review security of Pakistan 's nuclear program .
An official military statement said the physical protection and custodial controls at Pakistan 's nuclear sites and facilities has been recently upgraded .
The statement said the NCA gave approval for further tightening of different defensive layers and enhancing physical security as well as ensuring the effectiveness of watertight safety of materials , equipment and technology .
The NCA also adopted steps to improve personal reliability programs for people working in nuclear - related programs .
Scientists , engineers and military officers working in nuclear programs are routinely screened every 2 years according to a survey of Pakistan 's nuclear security by Italy 's arms control institution the Landau network .
2 Pakistani nuclear scientists were arrested 12 months ago and interrogated by US Federal Bureau of Investigation agents on suspicion of possible cooperation with the Taliban .
These arrests underlined fears that nuclear technology could fall into the hands of Islamic extremists .
Pakistan 's government has been developing a nuclear program to match arch - rival India 's since the 1970s and only went public with the program in 980500 when testing 5 nuclear devices .
Jane 's Defence Weekly estimates that Pakistan 's government possesses 25-50 nuclear warheads and has a uranium enrichment plant and plutonium reprocessing plant close to the capital Islamabad and at least 4 nuclear reactors across the country .
Pakistan 's NCA also decided on 030122 not to respond to India 's 3 missile tests this month and stated that Pakistan 's government has no desire to increase tension in the region .

Plutonium enough to produce 25 nuclear bombs which has gone unaccounted for at a Japanese nuclear facility is mostly due to measuring shortcomings and miscalculations .
A nuclear fuel reprocessing plant about 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) north of Tokyo in Tokaimura has extracted 6890 kilograms ( 15158 pounds or 7.6 short tons ) of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel since it began operating in 770000 .
A Japanese education and science ministry official said on 030128 that the total currently accounted for at the facility was 206 kg short of the plutonium initially estimated to have been produced by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel from power plants .
It is known to take 5-8 kg of plutonium to produce a nuclear bomb .
The official at the ministry 's nuclear safeguard office said that the case had been reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) of the United Nations .
The finding was also reported to the Japanese government 's Atomic Energy Commission on 030128 .
The education and scienc Ministry denied the possibility that any plutonium had been illegally removed from the facility .
The official said 94 kg of the missing plutonium is presumed to have dissolved into waste water without being measured .
The official added that another 29 kg disintegrated into another type of element .
The official said that plutonium may have been stuck to fuel tubes or mixed with waste water being processed to be solidified in glass and disposed of .
The official also pointed to possible errors in the estimate of plutonium extracted in the process .
The official said that there was a need for improvements in measuring and evaluating methods of plutonium .
The report was based on inspections at the Tokaimura facility done under IAEA safeguard rules designed to prevent the transfer of nuclear materials for production of nuclear weapons .
Tokaimura is a Pacific Coast complex of nuclear - related facilities and made headlines in 990000 when the world 's worst nuclear plant accident since Chernobyl in 860000 occurred at a uranium reprocessing plant there .
3 workers set off a critical reaction in 990000 when they poured too much uranium into a precipitation tank .
2 of the 3 workers later died .
Safety concerns at nuclear facilities in Japan were further highlighted on 030127 when a High Court upheld the suspension of operations of a troubled experimental fast - breeder reactor which has been shut since an accident in 950000 .

Officials stated that on 030128 Italy 's Internet network was hit by most serious Internet attack to date that severely disrupted Italy 's post offices .
The attack on Italy 's Internet network occurred as similiar attacks around the globe appeared to be subsiding .
A computer security expert named Fulvio berghella stated that the 030128 attack on Italy 's Internet network were the result of a digital worm named sq hell and that the attack was the worst Internet attack ever to hit Italy .
Fulvio berghella stated that the digital worm named sq hell was particularly virulent and replicated itself at the rate of 8000 times an hour .
Fulvio berghella heads an Internet security firm named securitynet .
Fulvio berghella stated that the digital worm named sq hell has a very high capacity to replicate itself and the digital worm named sq Hell is slowing down the Poste italiane computer network and making some computers inoperable .
The sq Hell is considered a computer worm .
A computer worm is unlike a computer virus and does not require a user to open an e-mail attachment or initiate any other type of command to infect the computer .
Paolo baldelli stated that online work at Italy 's 14000 post offices was severely disrupted by the Internet attack .

Indian Deputy PM identifies Southeast Asia as a new center for jihadi terrorism and urges closer international counter - terrorism cooperation following bombing in Bali .
20030204 Indian Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani stated at a public lecture in Singapore addressing academics , diplomats and business executives that Southeast Asia was becoming an operational center of terrorism and Governments must cooperate more closely to combat terrorism .
20021012 terrorists executing a bombing attack on the Indonesian resort island of Bali .
Indonesian authorities stated that the Islamic militant group Jemaah Islamiyah is responsible .
The attack is considered part of a global incitement to Jihad by al-Qaeda and its allies .
Advani stated --
The Bali attack established Southeast Asia as a potential new theater for the spread of jihadi extremism .
India previously knew that the operational center of jihadi terrorism is located near India due to the US - lead bombing campaign against extremist bases in Afghanistan .
Advani stated --
The menace of religious extremism has inspired international terrorism .
Terrorism should not be identified with any religion but jihadi terrorism has spread more global violence than any other extremist doctrine .
Advani stated --
Countries must continue in pursuing enhanced cooperation including intelligence sharing and border controls to combat the problem perpetrated by global terrorism and its concomitants -- drug trafficking , illegal arms trade and cross - border crime .
While the international consensus is that terrorism cannot be tolerated , the instruments the international community proposes to deal with terrorism do not meet the requirements of the problem .
Advani stated at a forum organized by the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies --
Countries must formulate and implement an integrated and cooperative approach to security by designing new security systems to protecting transport , communication and energy infrastructure from terrorist attack as well as obstructing terrorists ' funding .
Unilateral military action such as the standoff between the US and Iraq on disarming Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatens peace and could lead to unforeseen negative consequences .
The issue of weapons of mass destruction should be dealt with in the UN .
Rising tensions in the Middle East will affect oil prices .
The the region should provide greater energy security through developing alternative energy technologies .
Advani visited Singapore 20030202-20030205 .

A team of South African weapons experts departs for Iraq with UN approval to assist with Iraq 's disarmament program .
Political tensions are increasing as the U.S. threatens war against Iraq .
South African President Thabo Mbeki stated on 18 February 2003 that a South African team of weapons experts will depart to Iraq within days to assist with Iraq 's disarmament program .
In an address to parliament in Cape Town Mbeki stated --
A number of distinguished South Africans will travel to Iraq this week .
The weapons experts will be able to address all matters that relate to nuclear , chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction , missile systems , non - proliferation and disarmament .
Mbeki stated in his State of the Nation Address on 14 February 2003 that Iraq had accepted an offer from South Africa to send a team of weapons experts to assist Iraqi government officials , scientists and engineers with its disarmament program .
South Africa dismantled a number of nuclear weapons 10 years ago and was recently praised for its model cooperation with weapons experts invited to inspect its sites .
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad stated that South Africa is the only country in the world that has destroyed nuclear weapons .
Pahad stated that the group of South African experts will be able to assist the Iraqis by relating its experience .
The team of seven experts comprises Deon Smit , Ben Steyn , Phillip Coleman , super moloi , Daan van beeck , Peter Goosen and Tom Markram .
The team would visit Iraq in a consulting role and would not replace UN weapons inspectors .
Ben Steyn is a colonel in the South African National Defense Force .
Steyn oversaw the end of the apartheid regime 's chemical and biological warfare program called Project Coast .
Germ warfare expert Wouter Basson directed Project Coast before Steyn .
In 2002 Basson was acquitted in a South African court on all 46 charges filed against him including murder , fraud and drug dealing .
Basson 's trial related to his work as head of Project Coast .
Basson 's trial lasted 30 months .
Smit is a South African parastatal Armscor 's acquisitions general manager .
Coleman is the Managing Director of South Africa 's designated single small - scale facility in terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention .
Van beek is the director of non - proliferation and space in the Trade and Industry Department .
Van beek also heads the secretariat for the Council for the non - proliferation of weapons of mass destruction which oversees South Africa 's non - proliferation legislation .
Mbeki expressed confidence that the South African team of experts would contribute greatly to Iraq 's efforts to meet obligations imposed by the UN Security Council .
The Government of South Africa 's proposal to assist the Iraqi government was discussed with UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan and the UN weapons inspectors in Iraq .
This week the UN Security Council is debating U.S. threats to lead a war on Iraq after chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix delivered a progress report to the body on 14 February 2003 .
South Africa 's ambassador to the United Nations Dumisani Khumalo has been calling for public sessions of the Security Council instead of closed meetings in order to allow other countries to participate in discussions .
South Africa is the chair of both the African Union and Non - Aligned Movement and has been vocal in its opposition to an attack on Iraq .
South Africa states that the UN Security Council is the only body fit to deal with the matter .
In February 2003 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former President Nelson Mandela stated that U.S. President George W. Bush lacked foresight , could not think properly , and would cause a world holocaust if the U.S. continued with plans to wage war against Iraq .
Critics have stated that despite the dire effects an Iraqi conflict would have on the African continent South Africa needed to carefully assess balancing its economic relations with the United States with its serious opposition to a U.S. - led war .
In his speech before parliament 14 February 2003 Mbeki referred to this criticism as most unfortunate stating --
Critics suggest that the South African Government 's behavior with regard to the United States Government should be governed by economic benefits that derive from AGOA ( African Growth and Opportunity Act ) .
The South African government maintains very good relations with the United States Government .
Differences on any issue have never pressured the South African Government into submitting to the United States ' views .

Iranian opposition group accused Iran of building banned uranium enrichment sites as part of a nuclear weapons program with goal of altering power balance in region .
UN nuclear inspectors to depart for Iran to conduct inspections of 2 sites .
On 20 February 2003 Iranian opposition group National Council of Resistance of Iran ( NCRI ) stated that Iran was building banned uranium enrichment sites as part of a nuclear weapons program .
The statement was made on the evening preceding a UN team 's departure for Iran to conduct inspections at 2 nuclear sites .
U.S. Representative for NCRI soona samsami stated at a press conference in Washington D.C. that Iran 's strategy is to build weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons in particular in order to alter the balance of power in the region in its favor and to facilitate export of fundamentalism and terrorism .
UN International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and its director Mohamed ElBaradei depart for Iran 21 February 2003 to conduct an inspection at a site in Natanz where representatives of the NCRI have stated that the regime has concealed a test centrifuge .
NCRI showed satellite photographs of a site in Natanz portraying a cluster of warehouses in which the group claims the regime has hidden centrifuges used to enrich uranium that could be used in nuclear weapons .
Samsami stated that the clerical regime is taking advantage of the current crisis in the region and has accelerated its efforts to obtain nuclear weapons .
On 09 February 2003 Iranian President Mohammed Khatami recognized the existence of a uranium mine and extraction center but promised that the uranium would be used only for peaceful purposes .
The U.S. government was skeptical of Iran 's intentions and stated that Iran 's pursuit of a complete fuel cycle only made sense if it were pursuing nuclear weapons .
NCRI stated on 20 February 2003 that Iran 's clerical rulers are also building and have tested missiles that would eventually have a range of 4000 to 6000 kilometers ( 2500 to 3700 miles ) .
NCRI stated that the information on Iran 's weapons program had been supplied through their intelligence network within Iran and that satellite photographs were supplied by the Institute for Science and International Security .
The Institute for Science and International Security is a non - profit clearinghouse for security information and images .
Samsami stated --
The Iranian government had removed sensitive equipment from the Natanz site in anticipation of the IAEA inspection this weekend .
The Iranian government intended to bar IAEA entry to 1 of the 5 large buildings where the centrifuge is located and would claim that it is a warehouse similar to the other 4 .
Samsami provided street addresses of the suspect facilities .
ElBaradei planned to conduct inspections at the Natanz facility south of Tehran and at the Arak site southwest of Tehran on 22 February 2003 and 23 February 2003 .
NCRI stated that the Arak site produces heavy water for the production of plutonium .
Plutonium is used as a trigger in nuclear weapons .
Samsami stated that such weapons are a matter of survival for the regime in Iran .
Samsami stated that Iran 's clerical regime is in a tenuous position facing unprecedented social disenchantment and expansion of popular resistance and would therefore not hesitate to use weapons of mass destruction to stabilize its position .
The Government of Iran revealed earlier this month that it had discovered uranium deposits near the central city of Yazd and that a uranium oxide plant had been completed in the central city of Isfahan and would be complemented by an enrichment plant now under construction near Kashan to its north .
The plant in Yazd Province would produce concentrated yellow cake uranium while another facility at an undisclosed location would complete the cycle by producing finished fuel made entirely in Iran .

Kashmiri militant groups claim responsibility for attack on Indian police post in the disputed region that killed at least 11 people .
Indian officials claim that foreign infiltrators from Pakistan executed the attack but local Kashmiri groups call this baseless propaganda .
On 16 March 2003 Kashmiri militants claimed responsibility for an attack on a police post in the disputed state of Kashmir in India stating that they attacked to avenge the killing of their commanders by Indian troops .
The Hizbul Mujahideen is the largest group fighting Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan region .
A spokesman for Hizbul Mujahideen who declined to be identified stated to AFP --
The attack was in retaliation to the recent killing of district commander Amanullah and 3 other fighters of Hizbul Mujahideen by the Indian army in Kashmir .
Approximately 10 to 15 fighters from Hizbul Mujahideen , Harkatul Mujahideen , Harkatul Jihad - e - Islami and Al Badar attacked the camp before midnight on 15 March 2003 and into 16 March 2003 and killed at least 12 soldiers .
All the fighters who participated in the operation were local Kashmiris not infiltrators from Pakistan as claimed by Indian officials .
The Indian claim that cross - border incursions have increased is baseless and aimed at covering up its failures in occupied Kashmir .
The militants attacked the post in Gool in the Udhampur district approximately 95 miles north of Indian Kashmir 's winter capital Jammu .
At least 11 people were killed in the attack .
A spokesman for another Kashmiri separatist group called Harkatul Mujahideen agreed with the Hizbul official stating --
The attack was executed by local Kashmiri fighters affiliated with 4 groups .
If India blames foreign militants it is part of its propaganda to mislead the international community .
The Kashmir region is divided between India and Pakistan and is claimed by both .
India and Pakistan have fought 2 wars over Kashmir since each gained independence from Britain in 1947 .
India accuses Pakistan of funding and training rebels fighting to end Indian rule in Kashmir .
Pakistan denies the charge .
Since 1989 more than 37500 people have died in the insurgency in Kashmir .

Kazakhstan increased its air defenses to prevent any missiles fired during the Iraq war from threatening its Caspian coast .
The coast is a home to vital oil industry installation .
On March 21 , 2003 a spokesman for the Central Asian country 's defense ministry said Kazakhstan increased its air defenses to prevent any missiles fired during the Iraq war from threatening its Caspian coast .
The coast is a home to vital oil industry installation .
Defense ministry spokesman abish smailov told AFP that incidents occur when powerful weapons such as Scud missiles are used .
Smailov said that Kazakh air space is controlled at all times using measures involving anti - missile defenses , fighter jets and anti - terrorist units .
Kazakhstan 's increased air defenses come during Kazakhstan 's air force carries out exercises along its Caspian shores .
The shores are a center of Kazakhstan 's nascent oil industry .
Western countries said it is inadequately defended in the event of terrorist attack .
Ex - Soviet Kazakhstan is separated from Iraq by a 600 - kilometer ( 360 - mile ) section of the Caspian Sea and Iranian territory .
Kazakhstan is currently cooperating with the United States on strengthening defenses in this oil - rich area .
Kazakh politicians said that any overthrow of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein could reduce Western interests in exploiting Kazakhstan 's oil fields .
Investors could turn their attention to Iraq 's vast oil resources instead .

Several million Thai people use the drug .
The methamphetamine pills known as Yaa BAA have surpassed heroin as Thailand 's number one killer drug .
Several million Thai people use the drug .
The pill has become part of Thai society .
No other drug has become as integral in decades .
The effects on the brains of its consumers is disastrous .
Yaa BAA is known as crazy medicine in Thailand .
It has been targeted in a two - month anti - drugs crackdown that has resulted in the deaths of nearly 1,900 suspected traffickers .
There is much concern over the drug .
The drug 's popularity increased in the mid - 1990s .
It has made Thailand the world 's number one consumer .
Pierre - Arnaud chouvy and Joel meissonnier state in their book Yaa BAA recently published by the Institute of Research on contemporary Southeast Asia that the psychotropic drugs is used across society for both work and pleasure .
Construction workers , sailors , farmers and taxi drivers take the drug to help them through long working days .
Students use it to get through exam periods .
Clubbers use it to help them dance all night .
Yaa BAA possesses several qualities that have helped it supplant heroin as the drug of choice in Thailand .
The book states that the drug conveys a completely positive image .
It appears modern and inoffensive because it is synthetic .
The energy , confidence and euphoric feeling has given users an image as a drug of happiness .
The pills can also be easily consumed .
They can be popped or dissolved in a glass of water , taken intravenously , pulverized and inhaled , or smoked .
There are at least 90 types of the pill .
Yaa BAA is easy to manufacture and do not have any climate uncertainties like other drugs have .
Instructions on how to manufacture the drug are available on the Internet .
Heroin requires opium poppy as its raw ingredient and cocaine depends on yields from the coca plant .
The drug has an affordable price .
It cost 60 baht ( 1.50 dollars ) per pill on the streets before Thailand 's drug war started on February 1 , 2003 and push the price up 300 percent .
The pill costs five - cents to produce .
800 million pills entered Thailand from Myanmar last year .
The book states that the majority of the drug comes from Myanmar particularly the areas controlled by the Wa of the UWSA ( United Wa State Army ) .
The book is referring to the pro - Yangon ethnic group said to operate around 50 laboratories close to the border and the mobile production units .
Myanmar could become an unrivaled regional producer because of the links between the military rulers and the UWSA , and the jungle canopy where UWSA operate .
The military and UWSA links result in a lack of law enforcement .
The drug has become a specialty of the Golden Triangle where Thailand , Laos and Myanmar converge .
Much of the world 's opium is still produced there .
Chouvy and meissonnier say that methamphetamine is overtaking heroin as the production drug of choice in the area and is profiting enormously from the distribution networks that heroin trafficking has already established .
Five percent of Thailand 's population is now estimated to abuse methamphetamine .
The International Narcotics Control Bureau says the figure makes it the largest per capita consumer in the world .
The drug has been around in other forms for years .
It was first used in the 1920s as an antidepressant and then as a psychostimulant during World War II and the Vietnam War .
People recruited from impoverished ethnic minorities transport the pills along a multitude of routes .
Myanmar soldiers and Thai police and bureaucrats protect the cargo and allow them to eventually reach consumers in Thailand .
The books states that one pill will pass through seven intermediaries from the frontier runner to the retailer .
The retailer will usually sell more to the drug user than he or she requires .
This creates another dealer and explains the drug 's easy availability across Thailand .
Owners of boats in the southern coastal province of Ranong and construction foremen in Bangkok are known to force their workers to take the drug at the beginning of the workday .
Occasionally in rural areas the farmers dissolve the drug in a bottle which they drink while working .
Consumers are as young as seven and school has become one of the main hubs for trafficking of methamphetamine .
Thailand 's youth are the most at risk .

Afghanistan 's Interior Minister states that Taliban is not capable of destabilizing the Afghan government despite post - winter increase in attacks on government and foreign targets in the country .
Most of the attacks are carried out by Pakistan - based former Taliban members sent into Afghanistan and funded by drug smuggling operations or supporters in Pakistan .
On 03 April 2003 Afghanistan 's Interior Minister Ali Ahmad Jalali stated that Taliban and remaining al-Qaeda militants are not capable of destabilizing the Afghan government despite their increased attacks on government and foreign targets .
Jalali was speaking at his first press conference since taking office in February 2003 .
Jalali stated that the arrival of spring weather was the reason for the increased number of attacks by Taliban and remaining members of Osama bin Laden 's al-Qaeda network .
The traditional fighting season in Afghanistan is spring after the harsh winters .
Jalali stated that due to the warmer spring weather terrorist activities have increased particularly in the south and southeast regions of Afghanistan .
On 02 April 2003 the U.S. State Department stated that security in Afghanistan was volatile and unpredictable following a series of attacks against foreigners .
In a travel advisory the U.S. State Department stated that travel in all areas of Afghanistan including the capital Kabul is unsafe due to military operations , land mines , banditry , armed rivalry among political and tribal groups , and the possibility of terrorist attacks including attacks using vehicular or other bombs .
Taliban and al-Qaeda militants regularly launch attacks on government and foreign targets .
Last week a foreign Red Cross worker was murdered and 2 U.S. special forces were killed in an ambush while on patrol .
Jalali stated --
On 03 April 2003 Afghan militia forces were fighting Taliban extremists for the 3rd day near Spin Boldak in southern Kandahar province near the Pakistani border .
There are approximately 50-60 terrorists in the mountains of the southern Kandahar province and the Kandahar security forces are conducting operations against them .
On 02 April 2003 2 members of the security forces were killed and 1 was wounded .
7 of the terrorists were arrested .
Several former Taliban members were arrested in another operation in southern Ghazni province .
Jalali stated that among the former Taliban members arrested were several well - known former Taliban figures who were in Afghanistan to establish a network of terrorist organizations and to conduct anti - government activities in the area .
Among those arrested was former Taliban Education Minister Shaheed Kheil .
Jalali stated --
Approximately 15 suspected Taliban members were captured in Kandahar and 9 killed in operations launched after the 27 March 2003 murder of the Red Cross worker .
Most of the terrorist attacks are carried out by former Taliban members based across the border in Pakistan .
These members have confessed that they were sent from Pakistan into Afghanistan by the former Taliban leader .
The Pakistan - based former Taliban members conducting the attacks were being funded by former drug smuggling operations or by supporters in Pakistan .
The militants coming across the border from Pakistan into Afghanistan are organized by former Taliban elements .
Funds are transferred to the Pakistan - based former Taliban members from Karachi , Quetta and Peshawar but this does not indicate that the Government of Pakistan is supporting the former Taliban .
It is true that the interrogated Afghan Taliban stated that they had come from Pakistan and received their financial support from Karachi and Quetta but this does not indicate that the Government of Pakistan is supporting them .
There are many fundamentalists across the world as well as in Pakistan and Afghanistan .

A purported Ayman al-Zawahiri recording called for more suicide attacks , highlighting again the role of Egyptians in al-Qaeda , while suspicions grow that another Egyptian , Seif al-Adel , may have been behind the bombings in Saudi Arabia .
In a message aired 030521 by Arabic Qatar 's Al-Jazeera satellite channel , the purported voice of Ayman al-Zawahiri urged Muslims to force Westerners out of Muslim lands by attacking westerners and emulating the 010911 suicide attacks in the United States .
The speaker called for Muslims to muster their resolve and hit the embassies of America , England , Australia and Norway , and strike at the interests , companies and employees of America , England , Australia and Norway .
The speaker urged Muslims to attack and eject Americans , British , Australians and Norwegians out of Muslim homelands .
The speaker told Muslims not to allow Americans , British , Australians , Norwegians or other Western Christians to live in and benefit from the resources of Muslim countries .
Egyptian experts said this audiotape was a genuine recording of Zawahiri 's voice and proved Zawahiri was alive and still as influential as before in al-Qaeda .
Montasser al-Zayat , a lawyer who has represented Islamic militant suspects in Egypt , stated he was certain that the voice on the tape was that of Zawahiri , Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden 's top lieutenant .
Al-Zayat stated that the recording was Zawahiri 's voice , style and manner .
Dia al-Rashwan stated that he believed that the voice was Zawahiri 's and that the message bore Zawahiri 's characteristic emphasis on Islamic militant attacks against Arab governments which are allied to the United States .
Al-Rashwan is a journalist with Egypt 's government daily Al-Ahram and an expert on Islamic militants .
According to Rashwan , while bin Laden has always stressed international targets , Zawahiri has gradually shown increasing support for Arab targets as well .
Rashwan thought it was clear that Zawahiri is still second in command of al-Qaeda and that his stress on local ( Arab ) targets was influencing not only statements and actions by Al-Qaeda itself but also groups inspired by them .
Montasser al-Zayat said that he believed bin Laden was under secure protection with Zawahiri .
Zayat thought that security conditions sometimes dictate which one speaks out .
The situations and locations of Zawahiri , bin Laden and other top al-Qaeda members have been unknown since the United States struck the bases of al-Qaeda and its Taliban supporters in Afghanistan in 011000 .
Rashwan was unable to illuminate suspicions that Seif al-Adel , another Egyptian , might have masterminded the triple suicide bombings that killed 34 people , including 9 bombers , in Riyadh , Suadi Arabia 030512 .
Rashwan and other Egyptian experts said that Adel has become Al-Qaeda 's number 3 in command since becoming chief of military operations and succeeding Abu Hafs al-Masri .
Al-Masri was killed during the war in Afghanistan .
Adel was a top member in the Egyptian Islamic militant movement Al - Jihad .
Al-Jihad was led by Zawahiri and carried out many attacks in Egypt in the 1990s .
Adel left Egypt at the end of the 1980s for a Gulf Arab country , then traveled to Pakistan and then Afghanistan , where he helped train militants at some camps , Egyptian sources said on condition they not be named .
The Egyptian sources also said that Adel is close to both Zawahiri and bin Laden .
A senior Saudi official said 030519 that he believed Adel directed the bombings in Riyadh .
A senior United States official stated that it was still not clear whether Adel had personally been involved .
Like Zawahiri , Adel and Al-Masri were on a list of 12 most wanted suspects released by the US administration following the 010911 attacks .

Indian troops already fighting rebels in Kashmir are now engaged in a massive campaign to destroy poppy crops in the region .
Troops are facing angry farmers unaware that poppy cultivation is now punishable as a drug trafficking offense .
Indian troops already fighting rebels are now also engaged in a massive operation to destroy poppy crops in Kashmir .
Customs officials from the Federal Finance Ministry launched the campaign with security forces on 15 May 2003 in the southern Kashmir already affected by much violence .
The campaign requires troops to confront angry residents desperate to earn a living and unaware they are violating the law .
Senior Customs Officer V. Prabhakar stated that in 2003 the troops have destroyed opium poppy crops dispersed over 224.73 hectares ( 556 acres ) in 27 villages of Anantnag and Pulwama districts .
A similar drive was carried out in 2002 in the same region but did not stop residents from replanting .
Prabhakar stated --
The crop destruction of 2002 has not served as a deterrent .
The State administration has been lax on the issue .
No district official has ever taken steps to destroy the crop nor even reported that poppy crops are grown in his area .
Villagers in this region approximately 30 kilometers ( 18 miles ) south of Kashmir 's summer capital Srinagar stated that cultivating poppy crops was their only livelihood .
Farmer Ghulam Ahmed stated that he and other farmers have been growing poppy crops in their fields for years with no objection from anyone .
Ahmed stated that residents were shocked when officials and troops started destroying their harvest .
Many villagers grow poppy for their seeds used to flavor the Kashmiri bread known as kulcha .
Kulcha is always in great demand across the Himalayan region .
Bakers buy the seeds at 100 rupees ( two U.S. dollars ) per kilogram .
The lucrative byproduct is poppy SAP which can be processed into opium .
Rahti Begum was disconsolate as she watched her crop being destroyed .
Begum who raises the 3 children of her late son stated that her poppy crop is her only source of income .
Some officials admit the residents are not at fault .
A State official told AFP --
These villagers are innocent .
They cultivate the crop for poppy seeds unaware that its cultivation is punishable .
The villagers are inadvertently involving themselves in drug trafficking .
Officials state that because many farmers are unaware of these laws security forces make no arrests over poppy cultivation .
Prabhakar states --
If the cultivation continues unrestrained Kashmir may soon become notorious for narcotics .
This has potential serious consequences as Kashmiri youth may become addicted to narcotics grown in the region .
Poppy cultivation at present is largely organized by groups who use their own trucks to transport the drugs for sale in other parts of India .
In 2002 the Indian army seized 350 kilograms ( 772 pounds ) of narcotics in the Kashmir Valley .
He will intensify the anti - drug operation .
Federal and state officials and non - governmental organizations should cooperate on the anti - drug campaign and could end the poppy trade in Kashmir .
A crucial element of the campaign 's success is education of the public .
The region of Kashmir is already unstable from 14 years of the separatist violence that has killed 10s of 1000s of people and has devastated their once prosperous tourism industry .

Charles Kartman stated on 030630 that the 5 billion United States dollar North Korean nuclear reactor project is contingent upon progress of discussions between North Korea and South Korea regarding North Korea 's desire to obtain nuclear weapons .
Officials stated that Charles Kartman made the statement during talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Yoon Young - kwan .
Charles Kartman is executive director of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization .
Wi Sung - lac stated to reporters that Charles Kartman stated that the North Korean nuclear reactor project is linked to North Korea 's problem with nuclear weapons .
Wi Sung - lac is the head of the South Korean Foreign Ministry 's North American Affairs Bureau .
Wi Sung - lac stated that Charles Kartman stated that North Korea 's participation in the multilateral talks proposed by the United States to settle the nuclear crisis would help Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization resolve any policy differences over the North Korean nuclear reactor project .
Wi Sung - lac stated that Japan seems to have taken a similar position to south Korea and that there seems to be no determined policy despite various opinions in the United States .
Wi Sung - lac refused to give any details about the North Korean nuclear reactor project .
The Yonhap News Agency stated that Charles Kartman would reaffirm that the North Korean nuclear reactor project may not be completed if the North Korean government continued to pursue a nuclear agenda .
The United States Government has reportedly suggested the North Korean nuclear reactor project be halted as part of growing diplomatic pressure on the South Korean government .
South Korea has so far taken a cautious stance on the issue of the North Korean nuclear reactor project .
The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization was created under a 940000 Agreed Framework between North Korea and the United States .
The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization was to provide North Korea with 2 light - water nuclear reactors deemed unsuitable for weapons production and 500000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil per year .
Construction on the 2 light - water nuclear reactors started in 020800 and is already behind schedule .
Construction on 1 of the 2 light - water nuclear reactors was originally planned to be completed in 030000 .
The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization has maintained construction work on the 2 light - water nuclear reactors and has suspended shipments of fuel oil to North Korea from 021200 at the height of the nuclear stand - off which intensified in 021000 when the North Korean government admitted to running a nuclear weapons program based on enriched uranium .
The 940000 Agreed Framework between North Korea and the United States required North Korea to stop the use of graphite - moderate reactors used to produce weapons - grade plutonium at North Korea 's Yongbyon nuclear plant .
North Korea did not adhere to the 940000 agreed framework .
North Korea unsealed spent fuel rods from the graphite - moderate reactors , removed International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and withdrew from a nuclear non - proliferation treaty .
On 030609 North Korea admitted publicly for the first time that North Korea was seeking nuclear weapons capability .
United States officials do not know how far North Korea 's nuclear weapons program has progressed .
United States officials believe the North Korean government has already stockpiled enough plutonium for 1 or 2 nuclear weapons .
North Korea and the United States sat down for their first talks in three - way negotiations with China in 030400 but no further meetings have been scheduled .
United States government is seeking support from its allies to cut North Korea 's alleged funding from the sales of arms , illegal drugs and currency counterfeiting .
North Korea has accused the United States of planning a blockade of North Korea .

The Chinese government 's recent conclusion that North Korea has enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb has resulted in urgent diplomacy and plans for new talks .
Chinese deputy foreign minister was dispatched to North Korea to meet with Kim Jong - Il in an attempt to deescalate the situation .
Chinese diplomats were quoted in the Asian Wall Street Journal on 18 July 2003 as stating that China believes North Korea currently has enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb .
This belief caused the Government of China to accelerate diplomacy to resolve the crisis and to dispatch Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo to Pyongyang , North Korea on 12 July 2003 in this effort .
China is North Korea 's closest ally .
North Korea is a Stalinist regime .
Dai is presently in Washington D.C. to inform top U.S. policymakers of the outcome of the rare meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong - Il .
The newspaper stated that in recent weeks Chinese intelligence services concluded that North Korea is producing weapons - grade plutonium in sufficient quantities and possesses all the necessary components to assemble nuclear - tipped missiles .
A European official familiar with internal Chinese reports on the findings and Chinese diplomats were quoted in the newspaper as stating that the reprocessed plutonium is estimated to be sufficient to make at least 1 nuclear device .
The European official stated that North Korea has yet to combine the plutonium , triggering devices and other components into a bomb .
The Chinese reports in part verify recent claims made by the Government of North Korea that a number of spent nuclear fuel rods sealed in 1994 have been opened and have undergone reprocessing ostensibly to produce plutonium .
Until now China had stated that no evidence existed that North Korea was seeking nuclear weapons .
The U.S. government has been unable to confirm the North Korean government 's claims .
U.S. and South Korean officials have speculated that North Korea may have 1 or 2 nuclear bombs and may have the capacity to build 6 .
The Chinese government 's increasing concern was made evident by the new urgency of its diplomacy this week .
At a foreign ministry briefing on 17 July 2003 spokesman Kong Quan stated that the North Korean crisis was at a critical point .
Kong Quan stated that China is attempting to deescalate the situation by promoting talks and encouraging the 2 parties to make peace .
Kong Quan stated that it is important that the parties return to negotiations and continue with the trilateral talks that commenced in April 2003 .
The trilateral talks of April ended poorly with the North Korean government stating it possessed and might test nuclear weapons .
According to U.S. officials there is now a greater possibility that new talks could occur as North Korea appears willing to join another negotiating session with China and the United States .
There were also indications that the dialogue could be expanded to include Japan and South Korea .
South Korean officials have been quoted as saying that a dialogue could take place as early as August 2003 .
The United States government has always insisted on multilateral talks and has been eager to include its Japanese and South Korean allies .
North Korea has consistently demanded 1 - on - 1 talks with the U.S. government .
The Government of China emphasizes that it is more important to resume talks quickly than to refrain until the number of participants can be agreed upon .
China is a traditional ally and supplier of food and fuel to North Korea China and is therefore the country with the most leverage over North Korea .
China has demonstrated that it is willing to take advantage of this leverage .
Earlier in the crisis China stopped oil supplies to North Korea for several days .
2 days after North Korean leader Kim Jong - Il granted Dai the rare meeting for 14 July 2003 the regime 's Korean Central News Agency announced that China had recently decided to donate 10000 tons of diesel oil to North Korea .

Thailand will host ministers from China , Laos , India and Myanmar to discuss the elimination of precursor chemicals used in drug production .
Officials report that ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will hold talks this week in the northern Thai town of Chiang Rai aimed at eliminating precursor chemicals used in drug production .
The meeting will take place from 22 July 2003 - 25 July 2003 in one of the corners of the Golden Triangle and is the first of its kind .
The meeting will be attended by the ministers responsible for drug suppression in China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand .
Thai Justice Minister pongthep Thepkanjana will host the meeting .
Deputy chief of Thailand 's office of Narcotics Control Board ( ONCB ) rasanee Vistaveth stated the ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand are expected to adopt the Chiang Rai Declaration which will touch on the countries ' commitment to solving the problem of drugs , particularly with regard to precursors and chemical trafficking .
Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are contained in legal medicines and are used to produce illegal stimulants including speed or ice which are produced in large quantities in Myanmar and then trafficked to Thailand and China and beyond .
Chemical precursors are also used to turn raw opium into heroin .
Rasanee stated the ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand expect to openly discuss their countries ' weak points and the measures each country is taking to control these substances and prevent the substances from reaching the Golden Triangle area .
Rasanee said the governments of China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will explore ways to cooperate to intercept the illegal substances which are also used in legitimate industries .
Rasanee stated every country has its own way of controlling precursors but as matter of fact many precursors still flood the Golden Triangle area .
The ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will also address crop substitution initiatives for impoverished ethnic minorities who still rely on opium cultivation .
Rasanee referred to Thailand 's successful decades - long campaign to eliminate poppy growing from its territory and reported that Thailand is willing to help and share its own expertise on opium elimination by training officials .
The ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will discuss how to find markets for goods produced under crop substitution and other related programs such as eco - tourism and handicraft manufacturing .

La times probe finds strong evidence that Iran appears to be in the late stages of developing the capacity to build a nuclear bomb .
The Los Angeles Times in the 030804 edition Summarized results of an independent probe which strongly indicated that Iran is striving to become the world 's next nuclear power and appears to be in the late stages of developing the capacity to build a nuclear bomb .
The Los Angeles Times said the 3 - month investigation drew on previously secret reports , international officials , independent experts , Iranian exiles and intelligence sources and uncovered strong evidence that Iran 's commercial program masked a military undertaking .
The Times report said that scientists from Russia , China , North Korea and Pakistan plus advancing technology have propelled Iran 's nuclear program much closer to producing a bomb than Iraq ever was .
The Times pointed out that some experts predict Iran might produce an initial atomic weapon in the next 2-3 years .
No one is certain about the actual time frame for Iran 's nuclear weapon production .
Nuclear materials :
The Times said a confidential report prepared by the French Government in 030500 concluded that Iran is surprisingly close to having enriched uranium or plutonium for a bomb .
A foreign intelligence service provided a copy of the report to the times .
The French government warned other governments in the report to exercise the most serious vigilance on their exports to Iran and Iranian front companies .
The Times report said that samples of uranium taken by UN inspectors in Iran in 030600 tested positive for enrichment levels high enough to be consistent with an attempt to build a nuclear weapon .
The Iranian government also secretly imported 1.8 tons of nuclear material from China in 910000 and processed some of this nuclear material in order to manufacture uranium metal .
This uranium would be of no use in Iran 's commercial program but would be integral to weapons production .
foreign scientists ' involvement :
The Times quoted an unnamed Middle Eastern intelligence official that Pakistan 's role was bigger than thought from the beginning .
Abdul Qadeer Khan has helped Iran for years and is a Pakistani nuclear scientist regarded by the United States as a purveyor of nuclear secrets .
The Times said people inside Iran and foreign intelligence officials say that North Korean military scientists had been recently monitored entering Iranian nuclear facilities and are assisting in the design of a nuclear warhead .
There is a resort on the Caspian coast set aside for the exclusive use of North Koreans who are working on nuclear and missile projects in Iran .
This indicates the number of North Koreans working in Iran on such projects .
Russian scientists sometimes travel to Iran under false identities and work without the Russian government 's approval to help complete a special reactor that could produce weapons - grade plutonium .
New technology :
The report said Iranians have also approached European companies in recent months to buy devices that can manipulate large volumes of radioactive material .
This technology is for forging uranium metal and plutonium and switches that could trigger a nuclear weapon .
European intelligence sources said list of items the Iranians have wished to procure was a strong indication that Iran has moved to the late stages of weapons development .

Iran pledges to provide nuclear information to IAEA and sign nuclear protocol before 20040200 but not to indefinitely suspend uranium enrichment
20031129 Secretary of Iran 's Supreme National Security Council and senior Iranian nuclear official Hassan Rowhani stated --
By 20040200 when director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency of the UN Mohammed El-Baradei presents a new report Iran will provide all required information and means of verification to the IAEA .
The Iranian government will soon authorize its representative to the IAEA to sign the additional protocol to the Non - Proliferation Treaty .
20031126 the IAEA passed a resolution condemning Iran for 18 years of covert nuclear activities .
The resolution contained a passage warning that any further non - proliferation breaches by Iran would occasion stern action .
The US demanded that the Iranian government be brought before the UN Security Council for possible sanctions while Britain , France and Germany demanded that Iran be rewarded for cooperating with the IAEA since 20031000 but neither demand was met by the resolution .
Prior to 20031129 Rowhani had made no statement after the 20031126 IAEA resolution .
Rowhani stated --
The suspension of uranium enrichment is provisional and voluntary and intended to build confidence .
Iran continues to refuse to indefinitely suspend its uranium enrichment activities and reserves the right to recommence enrichment at any moment .
Iran 's uranium enrichment has prompted international concern that Iran may be capable of constructing an atomic bomb .
Iran stated that the purpose its nuclear activities is peaceful .
Rowhani stated that Iran wants to use enriched uranium to supply fuel for a future civil center .
Rowhani stated that the Iranian government will discuss with European governments the transfer of modern technology , nuclear technology and fuel to Iran .
An unprecedented mission by the foreign ministers of Britain , France and Germany in 20031000 convinced the Iranian government to --
Declare the entirety of the country 's nuclear activities .
Suspend uranium enrichment .
Sign the NPT additional protocol allowing stricter inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities .

German government sources stated that Wen Jiabao expressed interest in the plutonium - processing facility during the 031201 meeting with Gerhard Schroeder and that Gerhard Schroeder then promised to study Wen Jiabao 's request to purchase the plutonium - processing facility .
Gerhard Schroeder is on day 2 of a 3 day visit to China .
Gerhard Schroeder has visited China 5 times since 990000 and has focused the visits on boosting economic relations .
Gerhard Schroeder is accompanied by a strong business delegation including Siemens boss Heinrich von Pierer .
Any sale of plutonium - processing facility between China and Siemens is likely to be highly politically contentious and would need the approval of Gerhard Schroeder 's centre - left ruling coalition .
Gerhard Schroeder 's centre - left ruling coalition includes the environmentalist Greens .
A previous proposal to export the plutonium - processing facility to Russia collapsed in 010000 amid political concerns .
The political concerns were voiced by the Greens and others .
A Siemens spokesman in Germany stated that Heinrich von Pierer stated that Siemens was beginning talks with interested Chinese parties about a sale of the plutonium - processing facility .
A Siemens spokesman in Germany stated that Heinrich von Pierer stated that Gerhard Schroeder stated that Gerhard Schroeder is not against the sale of the plutonium - processing facility in principle .
A Siemens spokesman in Germany stated to the Agence France - Presse that Siemens was confident about the outcome of the talks to sell the plutonium - processing facility .
A Siemens spokesman in Germany refrained from commenting on the political aspect of the sale of the plutonium - processing facility .
A Siemens spokesman in Germany stated that export permission would be needed from the German Government and that the speed of any sale of the plutonium - processing facility would be contingent upon obtaining the correct political support .
A Chinese delegation has already inspected the plutonium - processing facility at Hanau in western Germany and Siemens has lodged an application for an export licence .
A spokeswoman for Germany 's Federal exports office confirmed Siemens 's application for an export licence had been lodged with Germany 's Federal exports office .
A spokeswoman for Germany 's Federal exports office stated to Agence France - Presse that the application for an export licence was being studied at ministerial level due to the political considerations involved .
The political aspect of the sale of the plutonium - processing facility will be difficult to negotiate .
The plutonium - processing facility is described as Europe 's largest plutonium plant producing fuel for nuclear reactors and was completed in 910000 at a cost of 700 million euros .
The plutonium - processing facility never went into operation and was abandoned in 950000 .
The Hanau plutonium - processing facility was abandoned after safety concerns .
Siemens stated that the Hanau plutonium - processing facility was also abandoned due to political difficulties at a time of growing debate about the future of nuclear power .
The Environment Minister of Hesse state was the Greens member Joschka Fischer who is now Germany 's Foreign Minister .
Hesse state includes Hanau where the plutonium - processing facility is located .
The plutonium - processing facility is estimated to be worth about 50 million euros on 031202 .
Siemens would not comment on the plutonium - processing facility 's estimated value of 50 million euros .
The environmental group Greenpeace urged the German Government to refuse the sale of the plutonium - processing facility .
Greenpeace stated that any sale of the plutonium - processing facility would effectively mark a German contribution to political destabilisation in the Far East .
Greenpeace stated that the fuel of the plutonium - processing facility could be refined to extract weapons - grade material and that the plutonium - processing facility should be scrapped .

A Chinese company has discussed buying a plutonium factory from a German technology group .
German Defence Minister Peter Struck stated that Germany will export a plutonium facility to China only if China guarantees to use it only for peaceful purposes .
4 December 2003 German Defense Minister Peter Struck stated that Germany will export a plutonium facility to China only if China guarantees to use it only for peaceful purposes .
The export is controversial .
Struck spoke in an interview to the Neue Presse daily .
The ruling centre - left coalition has criticized the proposed sale of the plutonium facility .
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder stated earlier this week he will investigate China 's request to buy the plutonium facility .
Schroeder recently visited China .
Struck stated --
Schroeder is correct to promise to examine the proposed exportation .
China must guarantee that the plutonium factory will not be used for military purposes but to produce atomic energy .
The sale is a highly emotional subject .
Struck is confident the coalition will settle its disagreements .
If China makes the guarantee struck will not be concerned about the sale of the facility .
Earlier on 4 December 2003 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao stated --
A Chinese company discussed a possible sale of the facility with owner German technology group Siemens .
The facility would be used for civil purposes and has no military goal .
The facility would have nothing to do with non - proliferation issues .
The facility was completed in 1991 .
The facility would have been Europe 's largest plant producing fuel for atomic power stations .
The facility never went into operation .
In 1995 the facility was abandoned under pressure from environmentalist party the Greens .
The Greens party is now junior partner in Schroeder 's coalition .
Senior green members such as co - leader Angelika Beer demand the sale to China be refused .
Germany is phasing out atomic energy for environmental reasons and senior green members state that it would be hypocritical of Germany to export an atomic energy facility .
According to press reports Greens Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer has agreed to a sale .
Some members of of Schroeder 's Social Democrat Party protest the sale .
Schroeder has publicly expressed his support of the sale .
The plutonium facility is located in Hanau , western Germany .
Joschka Fischer is the Greens ' most charismatic figure .

Al-Qaeda officer Mohammed Hamdi al-Ahdal reveals under interrogation that Saudis and Yemenis were involved in funding two terrorist attacks in Yemen .
Sources close to the investigation said on 031216 that al-Qaeda officer Mohammed Hamdi al-Ahdal has revealed under interrogation that unnamed Saudis and Yemenis were involved in funding two terrorist attacks in Yemen .
Saudi - born adhal 's alias is Abu Issam al-Maki and was al-Qaeda 's leader in Yemen .
Ahdal was arrested 031100 .
Ahdal revealed that the financing of the attacks against the USS Cole in 001000 and the French supertanker Limburg in 021000 October and other terrorist attacks went through Ahdal and originated from Saudis and Yemenis residing outside .
Ahdal told investigators the money came in installments and in small quantities in order to avoid detection .
Ahdal told the investigators all the financial and technical preparations for the attacks of both the USS Cole and Limburg were supervised by Ahdal and revealed that one of the two suicide bombers in the USS Cole attack carried the family name of Al - thore .
The Saudi - owned Al-majala weekly magazine 's current edition said that Saudis and Yemenis were implicated in the terrorist attacks in Yemen .
Al-majala said the Government of Yemen informed Saudi authorities of information revealed by Ahdal under investigation reagrding Saudi persons involved in the funding and that Yemeni authorities are preparing to receive Saudi officers in joining the investigation .
Al-majala said Yemeni authorities refused a Saudi request asking for Ahdal to be extradited for interrogation in Saudi Arabia because the Yemeni Constitution disallows the handing over of Yemeni citizens regardless of any charges .
A Saudi team of investigators is currently in Yemen .
Yemeni authorities believe Ahdal is the second - in - command to Ali Qaed Sunian al-Harithi .
Ali Qaed Sunian al-Harithi 's alias was Abu Ali al-Harithi .
Harithi was among the six al-Qaeda suspects killed in November 021100 in a missile attack by the US Central Intelligence Agency in the desert region of Al-Naqaa east of Sanaa in Marib province .
Yemen is the ancestral homeland of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and has been under pressure from the US government since the 010911 attacks on the US to crack down on presumed Al-Qaeda militants .

Live poultry smuggling undermines WHO and FAO efforts to restrict bird flu spread in Asia .
FAO and WHO advise countries to tighten border security .
Smugglers are undermining international efforts headed by the UN World Health Organization ( WHO ) and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) to eradicate bird flu by trafficking illegal live poultry that threaten to spread the disease to new areas .
Attempts to halt bird flu spread --
Agriculture and customs officials have increased border checks throughout the affected region to halt illicit trade .
Recent arrests of live poultry smugglers have occurred at checkpoints .
Most affected Asian countries have banned the import and export of live and slaughtered poultry to prevent the movement of potentially infected chickens and ducks across borders .
Senior FAO Animal Production and Health Officer in Asia Hans Wagner stated --
The FAO is concerned and well aware that there is copious uncontrolled movement of animals between borders in some Asian countries .
Smuggling occurs chiefly across the Green or uncontrolled borders of Vietnam , Laos , Thailand , Cambodia , Myanmar and China is likely a source for spreading the flu and other diseases .
Authorities in Vietnam stated that smuggling of meat and fruit from China has increased drastically in the past year .
Vietnam has experienced 9 flu fatalities and is the country worst affected by the disease .
Preventing smuggling from Vietnam is difficult because the country 's extensive land borders with China , Laos and Cambodia are poorly controlled by a notoriously corrupt customs department .
Most nations have tightened border controls in accordance with FAO and WHO advisories .
20040120 Cambodian authorities detained 10 in the southern province of Ta KEO for importing over 150000 duck eggs from Vietnam .
Cambodia has continuously been combating chicken and egg smuggling from Vietnam and is on high alert .
20040202 Taiwan tightened security against smugglers following the discovery in 20031200 of H 5N1 in ducks smuggled from mainland China .
Taiwan has previously successfully controlled an outbreak of the milder H 5N2 flu strain .
Taiwanese coastguards increased patrols around the island and several island groups off the Chinese mainland .
Approximately 8000 poultry and pig farmers were vaccinated against human flu to prevent it mutating with bird flu strains .
India is free of the disease but has deployed hundreds of soldiers to the border with Myanmar .
Myanmar has no reported H 5N1 cases but Indian officials suspect that poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand .
Thailand is one of the countries worst affected by the virus .
Hong Kong authorities have increased security along the border with China .
The Government stated that illegally slaughtered poultry imports increased by 15 percent from 2002 to 2003 .
The Customs and Excise Department reportedly seized 29266 kilograms of chilled or frozen poultry in 2003 compared with 1749 kilograms in 2002 .
Customs spokesman Richard law stated that the Department performs frequent checks on smuggling activities and have now increased efforts to inspect cargoes .
The H 5N1 flu strain has caused 13 deaths and reported outbreaks in 10 countries .

Volkswagen AG rejects a Chinese newspaper report that it had put a stop to technology transfers of its Santana sedans to joint venture partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp ( SAIC ) .
The China Business Post reported 040209 that German auto giant Volkswagen AG had decided against the further transfer of a technical platform for the Santana sedan model to joint venture partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp ( SAIC ) .
Discontinuing these technology transfers would cause several millions of yuan 's of losses to SAIC .
The China Business Post said SAIC had invested large sums in the scheduled acquisition of the Platform , including acquiring an auto manufacturing plant in Yizheng city in eastern Jiangsu province .
The reported plan was for SAIC to produce a new sedan model designed on the Santana platform and with the car set to be launched in 040500 .
The China Business Post said the termination was due in part to Volkswagen 's adjustment of strategies regarding China and to ineffective communication with Volkswagen 's Chinese partners .
Volkswagen on 040209 rejected this China Business Post report that Volkswagen had put a stop to technology transfers of Santana sedans to SAIC .
Volkswagen group China spokeswoman Melanie Behrens said that the statements made in the China Business Post about the stop of knowledge transfer from VW to SAIC are not true .
Behrens said that Volkswagen does not know where these claims came from and is still working on the subject and trying to clarify the situation .
SAIC was not immediately available for comment .
SAIC also has a joint venture with US - based General Motors .
Analysts said this issue highlights what might be an increasing problem for foreign auto makers as China 's government increases support of domestic car companies in hopes of building stand - alone name brands .
Many Chinese car - makers with overseas venture partners have begun researching and developing cars independently .
Volkswagen is China 's number one passenger car - maker and has two joint ventures in China , Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive Company and Faw ( First Automotive Works ) Volkswagen Automotive Company .
Approximately 633000 of Volkswagen 's own cars were sold in China in 030000 , up from 510000 in 020000 .
SAIC sold a total of 800000 sedans in 030000 .
SAIC 's sedan sales topped other domestic auto makers , most of which are volkswagens and General Motors ' buicks .

A draft report prepared for the EU executive stated that the European Union should massively increase research on security issues in order to better protect civilians from terrorist attacks .
The report is created by a working group including Research Commissioner Philippe Busquin and enterprise Commissioner Erkki Liikanen .
It recommends that up to two billion euros be spent per year on a vast pan - European research program .
The European Security Research Program ( ESRP ) would receive EU funding beginning in 2007 .
It is the most ambitious of several recommendations the group is likely to issue when it presents its final conclusions in two or three weeks .
The draft report recommends starting security research funding with one billion euros per year in 2007 .
It will then slowly increase the annual budget to two billion euros .
European spending currently lags behind the United States .
The United States ' Homeland Security Department receives one billion dollars annually plus research credit from the Defense Department .
The report stated that there is no reason why European Security Research should not be funded at a level similar to the United States .
The European Commission strategy allows for a preliminary period of studies and pilot projects from 2004 to 2006 .
It promotes EU - wide synergies in research on top safety issues including protection against bio - terrorism and improved networking between civilian and military authorities across the continent .
65 million euros have been earmarked for the 2004-2006 phase of the research program according to an exploratory Plan of Action presented by the Commission on February 3 , 2004 .
The Working Group on security research was formed last October and includes EU parliamentarians and experts from related industries in addition to the two commissioners .

French anti - terrorist judge calls terrorism serious threat despite dispersal and weakening of al-Qaeda .
Restraining extremist groups is becoming increasingly difficult because of how the groups are financed .
France 's top anti - terrorist judge Jean - Louis Bruguiere stated to AFP 29 February 2004 that al-Qaeda is still capable of inspiring people to carry out attacks despite being much weaker since the 11 September 2001 attacks and the U.S. - led war in Afghanistan .
Bruguiere has led the French legal effort against extremism and terrorism in recent years .
Bruguiere stated --
The global fight against terrorism is against an increasingly elusive enemy with access to funds virtually impossible to control .
The threat comes from long - standing members of al-Qaeda .
Al-Qaeda is an organization which still exists but has been significantly weakened by the neutralization and capture of a number of its members and of those in charge .
In an interview in Monaco Bruguiere called global terrorism a scattered and polymorphous threat .
Bruguiere was in Monaco attending a meeting of the international organization involved in Mediterranean political studies called club of Monaco .
Dozens of alleged members of al-Qaeda have been captured or killed since the group claimed responsibility for the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington D.C. but authorities have not been able to locate al-Qaeda 's leader Osama bin Laden or his top deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri .
On 24 February 2004 Zawahiri appeared in 2 taped messages broadcast by the Arab - language Al-Arabiya and Al-Jazeera television stations calling in remarks attributed to him for renewed attacks on the United States .
Bruguiere stated --
Restraining extremist groups particularly across Europe was becoming increasingly difficult because of how the groups are financed .
The networks operating in Europe benefit from micro - financing and not from macro - financing .
Fraudulent charge cards could be used to withdraw significant sums which are then distributed through micro - channels outside the classic financial circles and are practically impossible to detect .
Use of false credit cards is growing .
It is necessary to expand existing laws to combat the funding mechanisms .
All existing legal or institutional measures are insufficient to neutralize this threat .
Al-Qaeda is only 1 of many worldwide threats among the many radical Islamic organizations involved in an international jihad and sharing the al-Qaeda strategy that are pursuing regional options .
The groups are particularly active in Africa , Asia and Europe .
Bruguiere made these comments before going into a meeting with approximately 40 high - ranking or former top international officials .
Since the September 2001 strikes on the United States deadly large - scale attacks have occurred in other parts of the world .
Among the targets have been a synagogue in northern Tunisia , a nightclub in Bali , a hotel in Kenya and numerous locations in Chechnya and Russia .
Analysts have warned that Iraq could become a breeding ground for terrorist organizations if a political solution is not found soon .
The United States and Britain invaded Iraq nearly a year ago despite massive international opposition .

Amnesty International urges Laos to treat surrendered ethnic Hmong rebels humanely while Lao officials claim there are no rebels and no insurgency .
The rights group states that Lao troops promised rebels amnesty and a living area if they surrender but has received conflicting reports as to whether the Lao Government has upheld this agreement .
On 05 March 2004 Amnesty International called on the Lao Government to ensure that 100s of ethnic Hmong anti - government insurgents and their families who had reportedly surrendered were treated humanely .
From its London headquarters Amnesty International issued a statement saying that the Lao People 's Democratic Republic has international obligations in this regard under the Geneva Conventions and the 2 UN covenants .
On 03 March 2004 the U.S. government - funded network Radio Free Asia reported --
Up to 700 insurgents and their relatives and 8 rebel commanders surrendered after government troops surrounded several northern holdouts in late February 2004 .
Troops used leaflets and megaphones to help communicate to the rebels that authorities would grant them amnesty and a special living area if they surrendered .
Approximately 300 people surrendered near Luang Prabang after traveling on foot from farther north and between 300 and 400 people surrendered in Xieng Khouang province .
Amnesty International stated it had received conflicting reports as to their reception and treatment by the authorities .
Lao Foreign Ministry Spokesman Yong Chanthalangsy denied that anyone had surrendered insisting also that there were no rebels in the impoverished communist nation .
Yong Chanthalangsy told AFP that no one surrendered , that there are no rebels and there is no war in Laos .
Yong Chanthalangsy stated that there are many people coming out of the forests to take advantage of Lao poverty eradication programs .
Following a series of deadly highway ambushes and bomb blasts the Lao Government called in August 2003 on Hmong and others whom they called ethnic minority bandits to lay down their arms , to come out from the forest and to rejoin society .
The Lao Government warned that failure to do so would result in heavy consequences .
Small bands of ethnic minority rebels predominantly Hmong remain from the CIA - sponsored guerrilla army mobilized to wage the United States ' secret campaign in Laos during the Vietnam War .
Some 300000 Hmong fled to Thailand after the Communist takeover in Laos in 1975 but the remaining rebels have continued a low - level , ineffective insurgency for nearly three decades .
The Lao military has been accused by human rights groups of using harsh and often brutal tactics to eliminate them .
Amnesty International called on the Lao Government to provide UN agencies and other non - governmental organizations access to all those who have put down their arms in order to assist with basic humanitarian needs .
Amnesty International stated --
Longer term assistance with their reintegration into Lao society will also be needed .
It is essential that neutral observers are given access to these groups of former rebels in order to independently assess their situation and the veracity of ongoing claims of serious human rights violations being made by overseas ethnic Hmong groups .
The Lao Government should seize this opportunity to find a peaceful solution to decades of fighting and the high human cost on all sides of the conflict .
In January 2004 , U.S. - based Lao exiles warned that Lao forces had launched a new offensive against 1000s of Hmong rebels and civilians and accused the communist regime of using starvation as a weapon of war .

Desiring admission into the European Union , Albanian government increased efforts against drug trafficking by strengthening laws , seizing illegal drugs , and investigating possibly corrupt police officials .
Under the pressure of the European Union the Albanian Government has escalated its fight against drug trafficking by preparing a new strategy to halt the smuggling of hashish and heroin over Albanian territory from Asia towards the West .
A recent EU report on Albania stated the situation in Albania , which has remained an important country for the traffic of narcotics , is worrisome .
The report suggested the Tirana government adopt an efficient strategy in the Government 's efforts against drug trafficking .
Albanian interior minister Igli Toska stated --
The fight against drug trafficking will be the Albanian government 's main challenge in 2004 .
The Albanian Government has been working on a project of national strategy which will require international support and cooperation .
Albania 's geographic position , Albania 's trade with Turkey and Greece , and the situation after the Kosovo war are all elements Albanian criminal groups profit from , thereby making Albania an important stop for the transit of narcotics .
In July 2004 the Albanian government plans to present a set of anti - Mafia laws which will allow confiscation of property belonging to persons involved in criminal and illegal activities .
Albanian justice minister Adrian dvorani stated the anti - Mafia laws also provide for the special protection of witnesses or people involved in illegal trafficking who decide to testify and will enable a more efficient strategy .
Albanian officials aspire to EU membership .
The Albanian government has made a significant development in the government 's fight against drug smugglers in 2004 .
In 2003 Albanian police infiltrated an international drug network operating between Kosovo , Macedonia , Albania and Italy and controlled by the Kosovo Albanian and Turkish criminal groups linked with the Calabrian Mafia organization N'Drangheta .
In May 2004 approximately 100 policemen -- 25 of them in top positions -- were dismissed on suspected ties with organized crime .
60 others have been investigated on similar charges .
Toska stated there will be no smugglers without corrupted policemen and Toska announced tougher measures against policemen and security officials linked with criminal groups .
The EU report quotes the names of several Albanian politicians directly or indirectly involved in drugs trafficking but no measures have so far been taken against the politicians .
Albanian police forces have seized more than 200 kilos ( 440 pounds ) of heroin and around 8 tons of cannabis between November 2003 and May 2004 , double that which was seized in 2003 .
Experts say the figures of drugs seized are insignificant compared to the estimated quantities of narcotics that are smuggled through Albania .
International Police experts based in Tirana estimate the value of the narcotics in transit at over 2 billion dollars ( about 1.6 billion euros ) per year .
Experts estimate the amount smuggled through Albania makes up approximately 25 to 30 percent of the narcotics smuggled into the European market from the Balkans .
Albanian police official Xhavit Shala stated Albanian smugglers are linked to the international criminal organizations like ( the Italian ) sacra Corona UNITA , Cosa Nostra , the Turkish , Russian , Macedonian and Kosovar mafia , and the Colombian drug cartels .
Bujar Mema of the Albanian Interpol Office stated that drug smugglers have reappeared due to increasing consumption of narcotics in Europe and the production of opium from Afghanistan , which has reached the level of the years before the US intervention in 2001 with 3600 tons produced in 2003 .

On 26 June 2004 Myanmar 's military rulers burned over 710 kilograms of opium , 353 kilograms of heroin , 2.6 million methamphetamine pills , and other drugs in a make - shift incinerator set up at Yangon 's drugs Elimination Museum .
International diplomats witnessed the incineration .
The incinerated drugs had a total value of approximately 247 million dollars .
Myanmar 's military rulers incinerated the drugs to mark the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking .
One of the heads Myanmar 's Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control , General Khin yii , stated the drug incineration on 26 June 2004 was the 18th time the regime had incinerated tons of illegal narcotics .
Khin yii stated that 14.45 billion dollars worth of drugs have been destroyed since the drug destroying events began in 1990 .
Khin yii stated that opium production and poppy cultivation has declined since 1990 but that methamphetamines are replacing opium as the main choice of traffickers .
Khin yii stated that stimulant tablets are becoming a threat but did not elaborate on the extent of methamphetamine production or trafficking .
The United Nations stated that opium production has declined by 24 percent in Myanmar since 2003 .
In March 2004 the United States stated that while Myanmar had reduced poppy cultivation Myanmar remained the world 's 2nd ranked supplier of opium from which derivatives such as heroin are made .
Thai government stated in early 2004 that Thai government was considering building a high - security fence along Thailand 's border with Myanmar in a bid to stop smugglers trafficking illegal drugs into Thailand .

During the mass Ortega crossed himself and asked Obando to forgive him .
Obando stated that the pardon that has been offered and accepted is an indispensable premise of a stable and durable peace .
The Sandinistas have been accused of persecuting Catholic priests during the 1979-1990 Sandinista rule .
The Sandinistas accused the Church of anti - government activities .
The Sandinista National Liberation Front ( FSLN ) is currently Nicaragua 's primary political opposition group .
The Sandinista group is named after Agusto Cesar Sandino .
In the 1930s Agusto Cesar Sandino fought the US marines that supported the government of Anastasio Somoza 's father .

Chinese hackers are suspected of attempting to hack the website of Japanese war shrine Yasukuni Shrine .
This hacking attempt has coincided with the Asian Cup final , which leads some analysts to believe that the suspected attacks are run - up to the football final between Japan and China .
The website of a controversial war shrine in Toyko called Yasukuni Shrine experienced many abnormal visits from abroad on August 7 , 2004 .
The abnormal visits caused the website to have browsing problems .
At one point more than 30000 visits to the Yasukuni Shrine website were made at the same time .
The homepage of the website of Yasukuni Shrine was not damaged by the hacking attempts .
No official was immediately available from Yasukuni Shrine to confirm the reports .
Yasukuni Shrine and Japanese government offices may have come under cyber attack from Chinese hackers in the run - up to the Asian Cup football final between Japan and China in Beijing on August 7 , 2004 .

Cyber attacks target Japanese Foreign Ministry homepage .
A Japanese official blames South Korean hackers for the attacks , citing the passage of a Japanese resolution that stressed the Japanese government 's claim to an island chain controlled by South Korea .
A massive amount of information flooded the homepage of the Japanese Foreign Ministry , www.mofa.go.jp , beginning at 9:50 am ( 0050 GMT ) on 17 March 2005 .
Access to the website has been erratic .
Japanese foreign press secretary Hatsuhisa Takashima termed the flood of information a cyber attack and stated that officials are working to fix the problem .
Kyodo News cited a Japanese government source and stated the latest attack may have come from South Korea .
On 16 March 2005 a Japanese local assembly passed a resolution stressing the Japanese government 's claim to a small island chain controlled by South Korea .
Anti - Japanese protests occurred in Seoul after the passage of the resolution .
Japanese government websites have come under occasional cyber attacks especially from countries which Japan invaded in the first half of the 20th century .
In January 2005 , administrators of the Yasukuni Shrine dedicated to Japan 's war dead stated the Yasukuni Shrine 's website had been the target of Internet attacks .
Most of these attacks were via e-mails written in Chinese .
In 2000 , hackers accessed Japanese government websites and left messages in Chinese and English ranging from insults to attacks on Japan 's wartime past , after Japanese conservative groups held a forum in the western city of Osaka to deny the 1937 massacre in the Chinese city of Nanjing by Japanese troops .

Taiwan 's chip company United Microelectronics Corp ( UMC ) announced on March 21 , 2005 that it would obtain a 15 percent stake in China - based chipmaker hejian technology through a compensation package .
Taiwan 's chip company United Microelectronics Corp ( UMC ) announced on March 21 , 2005 that it would obtain a 15 percent stake in China - based chipmaker hejian technology through a compensation package .
The stake was valued at 3.5 billion Taiwan dollars ( 110 million US dollars ) and the investment goes to the core of cross - Straits investment ties .
Both companies are being investigated in Taiwan for alleged breach of trust .
UMC Chairman Robert Tsao said the company had submitted a letter to Taiwan 's Investment Commission asking for assistance in transferring the stake .
It said it was compensation for previous assistance .
UMC manufactures cutting - edge microchips .
The chips are installed in a wide range of computers and electronics found in mobile phones , televisions and cars .
The technology is highly prized in Taiwan .
Market analysts believe the assistance involved a technology transfer from UMC to hejian and the compensation through the stake represents a payment .
No cash changed hands .
Tsao said the letter followed a verbal promise made by hejian technology to pay UMC a reasonable amount of compensation .
That included a commitment to merge the two companies .
Tsao said no formal written agreements had been signed .
Both companies would next seek a strategic partnership if the Investment Commission approved the deal .
UMC is the world 's second largest wafer foundry and has recognized its investment in hejian which had previously been denied .
Taiwan authorities lifted a ban in March 2002 on mainland - bound investment in eight - inch ( 200 millimeter ) silicon wafer plants .
This followed assurances from potential investors that the island would not lose out on transferred technology .
Prosecutors raided the homes and offices of UMC executives in February 2005 as part of a probe into the alleged illegal supply of funds , technology and human resources to hejian .
Hejian was founded in November 2001 with capital of 350 million U.S. dollars .
Its Chairman Hsu Chien - hua has been barred from leaving Taiwan after being bailed out of police custody for 10 million Taiwan dollars .
Tsao and UMC vice chairman John hsuan have also been named as defendants in on - going investigations .
UMC has never sought government approval for China - bound investments .
The company has previously called hejian technology a friendly company while denying any financial ties between the two .
Only UMC peer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has received official approval to build a plant in Shanghai .
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is the world 's biggest contract microchip - maker .

Software protection companies warn of a new form of cyper - attack called ransomware .
If it installs successfully , ransomware encrypts text files and displays a ransom note demanding 200 dollars to supply decryption software to restore the data to its original form .
20050601 anti - virus program manufacturer Symantec stated on its website ( http://www.Symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/Trojan.pgpcoder.html ) that the attacking program is a Trojan horse .
Trojan horses do not replicate from machine to machine as viruses do .
Symantec stated that the ransomware enters the computer via weaknesses in the victim 's Web browser and then scans the hard drive and encrypts any text - based documents found .
20050604 the British weekly New Scientist stated that 1 case of ransomware has been discovered which may pioneer a new and dangerous generation of malicious software .
The known ransomware program is titled pgpcoder in an attempt to undermine the legal , popular and highly secure encryption product pretty good privacy .
New Scientist stated that the California web - filtering company websense discovered pgpcoder and notified the FBI .
Pgpcoder used an unsophisticated algorithm to encrypt the data so that a computer consultant was able to decode the documents easily .
New Scientist stated that future virus writers may compel victims to pay by encrypting files using military - grade systems .
Ransomware 's weakness is that the demand includes a traceable contact email address and electronic bank account .

On June 3 , 2005 Israeli military officials stated in the New York Times that Syria test fired three Scud missiles a week ago in an act of defiance to the United States and the United Nations .
One of the missiles broke up over two Turkish villages .
It caused no injuries .
The officials stated the missile tests were normal .
It was Syria 's first since 2001 and caused embarrassment to Turkey .
Syria decided to make the missile tests public because the U.S. silence about them was unsettling .
The Israeli officials in Tel Aviv told the daily that the missile tests were part of a Syrian missile development project using North Korean technology .
The three missiles were the older Scud B that has a range of 300 kilometers ( 185 miles ) and two Scud D 's with a range of 700 kilometers ( 435 miles ) .
The missiles are designed to deliver air - burst chemical weapons .
The official said the launchings on May 27 , 2003 were Syrian President Bashir al-Assad 's response to U.S. and UN pressures that forced al-Assad to withdraw Syrian troops from neighboring Lebanon .
This was in the wake of the February assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Harari .
A senior Israeli military official said the tests are probably needed for the missile project but Bashir is taking a risk and sending a message .
Anti - Syrian journalist Samir kassir was killed June 2 , 2005 when a bomb exploded under kassir 's car in Beirut .
The attack is blamed on the pro - Syrian regime and widely condemned at home and abroad .
Syria angrily denied the accusations through its official news agency , SANA .
The Israeli officials said the Syrian missiles were launched from northern Syria Newar minakh .
One was sent about 400 kilometers ( 250 miles ) to southernmost Syria near the Jordanian border .
The missile that that broke up was launched southwest toward the Mediterranean , over the Turkish province of Hatay and shed debris over two villages there .
The Israelis said they had film of the launching and breakup .
The Turkish Ambassador to the United States Osman Faruk Logoglu told The New York Times there were no casualties in the missile breakup .
Osman Faruk Logoglu added that Syria had apologized for the technical mishap .

The China Times stated that the Hsiung Feng cruise missile was developed by the military - run chungshan Institute of Science and Technology , has a range of 1,000 kilometers ( 600 miles ) and could be used to attack military bases in southeast China .
The China Times stated that once the missile was deployed it would mark the first time that Taiwan is able to put strategic weapons into use and that the political and military impact of this would be far - reaching .
The Times said Defense Minister Lee jye witnessed the test firing of the missile from chiupeng military base in the southern Pingtung County and that the missile flew over 500 kilometers ( 300 miles ) before hitting its target .
The defense ministry declined to comment on the report .
The report did not specify when the test took place but speculated that it could have been in March .
The missile is expected to go into pilot production later in 050000 or 060000 .
Taiwan is striving to build up its missile defense capabilities to counter the military threat from China .
Officials state that China has targeted Taiwan with approximately 700 ballistic missiles .
Taiwan 's cabinet approved a revised arms deal with the United States in 050500 worth almost 15.5 billion dollars after a previous proposal was rejected by parliament .
The arms package over a 15 - year period beginning in 050000 includes 8 conventional submarines , a modified version of the Patriot anti - missile system and a fleet of anti - submarine aircraft .
The package is pending final approval by Parliament .
This large budget proposal has provoked debate Taiwan as critics said the spending could further provoke China and heighten cross - strait tensions .

Brazilian government and Abbott Laboratories agree on lower price for AIDS drug Kaletra in response to Brazilian threat to violate the patent .
According to WHO studies the price of the drug was exorbitant and the Brazilian government demanded that Abbot lower the price .
On 08 July 2005 Brazil 's Ministry of Health stated that U.S. company Abbott Laboratories has agreed to reduce the price of its HIV / AIDS drug Kaletra to prevent Brazil from violating the company 's patent as it had threatened .
The ministry said in a statement --
The agreement made with Abbott guarantees the Ministry 's proposed objectives ensuring a significant price cut for the drug over the next 6 years .
Abbott agreed to a technology transfer procedure so that Brazil 's state - run farmanguinhos laboratories can begin producing Kaletra in 2009 .
The agreement guarantees access to Meltrex by Brazilian patients .
Meltrex is an updated version of Kaletra that is pending approval by U.S. health authorities .
Over the 6 years which the Agreement covers Brazil expects to save up to 259 million U.S. dollars in drug purchases .
The Ministry recently stated that an agreement with Abbott would save Brazil 18 million U.S. dollars in its 2006 budget to provide AIDS patients free anti - AIDS treatment consisting of a cocktail of anti - retroviral drugs including Kaletra .
Currently 24000 patients in Brazil receive Kaletra .
The number is expected to increase to 60000 by 2011 .
On 24 June 2005 Brazil declared Kaletra a drug of national interest and demanded that Abbott decide within 10 days to either agree to lower its price for the drug or face a violation of its patent .
On 24 June 2005 Brazilian Health Minister Humberto Costa stated that the price paid by the Brazilian Government to purchase Kaletra represented a yearly cost of 2630 U.S. dollars per patient .
Costa stated that this price is considered exorbitant because studies of the World Health Organization ( WTO ) showed that for large - scale production the fair price including a considerable margin of profit should range from 480 to 540 U.S. dollars per patient per year .
Costa stated that Brazil planned to have a less expensive generic copy of the patented drug produced locally by a state - owned company .
Illinois - based Abbott stated that Brazil 's demands were illegal and warned that developing unproven alternative HIV medication posed significant consequences for patients .
Abbott stated that it remained open to an agreeable solution .

Pakistani analysts say that Pakistan 's network of madrassas has close links with Islamic extremists in Britain , who supply them with extremist recruits and funding .
Pakistani analysts said on 050715 that Pakistan 's network of madrassa Islamic schools has close links with Islamic extremists in Britain , who supply them with extremist recruits and vital funding .
On 050714 British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw expressed concern over what goes on in some Pakistani madrassas .
It has emerged that Shehzad Tanweer was one of the terrorists who carried out the bombing of an underground subway train at Aldgate in east London .
Tanweer was said by his uncle to have gone in 041200 to a Pakistani madrassa , wanting to learn to recite the Koran by heart .
Sources in Pakistan said that British authorities should look inside British borders where the South Asian community is turning to increasingly extremist religious views .
Kamila hyat of Pakistan 's Human Rights Commision said that militancy is being exported in the reverse direction .
Younger Pakistanis coming from Britain have very extreme and hard - line views and view British culture as decadent .
When Pakistani - British youngsters come to Pakistan they are surprised to see women walking around without burqas .
Analysts say Tanweer 's trip to Pakistan was by no means unusual , as many Pakistani families who emigrated some 40 or 50 years ago and settled in Britain send their children for religious teaching at madrassas .
Hyat said they want to ensure their children are not alienated from their family faith and hope a brief stint of a few terms will help ground them in Islamic and Pakistani culture .
Hyat said that complaints have nonetheless been received from parents in Pakistan who are very concerned about teenagers who graduate and then go back to the UK for University .
The parents of some madrassa students are saying that the young men are somewhat confused when away from the UK for the first time and are consistently being approached by other Pakistanis or by Arabs who attempt to get them to join extremist groups .
Such students bring extremism back to the UK when coming back home .
Madrassas continue to produce a peculiar state of mind in students , said Hasan Askari .
Askari is the former head of political science department at Lahore 's Punjab University .
Askari said that these students having a state of mind of religious orthodoxy are vulnerable to violence and extremism .
Some of the radical religious schools in Pakistan have thrived on funds regularly coming from supporters among the Muslim community in Britain .
Security sources say that in one case , several thousand pounds were sent to outlawed Sipah - e - Sahaba of Pakistan in 030000 .
Pakistani security officials informed the British authorities and identified the man who sent the money as Mullah Hamid .
Mullah Hamid was a prayer leader in a mosque in Glasgow .
Pakistan admits that some of the estimated 10,000 madrassas in Pakistan are breeding grounds for extremism .
Madrassas have been a part of Muslim social life on the Indian subcontinent for decades .
In the 1980s they became a recruiting ground for the US - sponsored militant movement against the Soviet occupation of neighboring Afghanistan .
President Pervez Musharraf has been campaigning since early 030000 for reform of madrassas .
Many madrassas are unregulated and the International Crisis Group says 1.5 million students attend such Islamic schools .
Education Minister Javed Ashraf stated on 050715 that efforts were working to get madrassa leaders to broaden the curriculum beyond rote Koranic learning and to encompass useful and employable skills .

20050705 terrorist attacks may prompt counter - extremism measures sufficient to force Islamist militant organizations in London into convert operations via the Internet .
Anti - terrorist laws in the UK strengthened and suspected extremists were pursued more aggressively after the 20010911 attacks in the US .
The 20050707 terrorist attacks that killed 56 on London underground trains and a double - decker bus prompted demands for further anti - terror laws and surveillance of Islamist militants .
Director of the Center for the Study of terrorism at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland Magnus ranstorp stated that the militants may be forced underground into the cybersphere , which has potential utility for command , communication , and especially recruitment .
Londonistan is the Islamist core operating in London .
The two main components of londonistan are the international Jihad Movement and the exiled opposition to current Arab or Muslim regimes .
Londonistan emerged in the 1990s because London was a center for finance and Arabic media and because of Britain 's lenient asylum laws .
20050718 the Royal Institute of International Affairs ( Chatham House ) stated --
By the mid - 1990s British intelligence agencies and police were aware that London was expanding as a base for promoters , funders , and planners of terrorism in the Middle East and elsewhere .
Officials did not perceive any threat to national security and the individuals continued their activities with relative impunity .
Ranstorm stated that the militants have previously cautiously avoided incitement to violence .
Foreign Governments opposed the British government 's passive policy .
Government crackdown --
In 2004 British authorities dismantled the Finsbury Park mosque in London , the previous venue of Salafist jihadists .
Since then the militants have moved to informal areas , study groups , and youth centers .
The former imam of Finsbury Park mosque is Egyptian - born Abu Hamza al-Masri .
Masri is crippled with 1 eye and 1 arm and is incarcerated in Belmarsh prison awaiting a 20060100 trial on charges of inciting racial hatred and murder .
Abu Qatada is a Palestinian considered the spiritual chief for Al-Qaeda in Europe .
He is under house arrest after serving 2.5 years at Belmarsh .
French researcher Dominique Thomas stated --
The remaining preachers must adopt a clandestine attitude or risk surveillance or arrest .
Islamist groups such as those seeking reform in Saudi Arabia , Egypt , or Libya will be stymied .
Londonistan 's imminent disappearance may force militants to seek a clandestine meeting place on the Internet .
There are a number of websites managed or administered from London and the Internet facilitates global connection .

China 's research and development spending will catch up with that of the EU in 090000 or 100000 if current spending trends continue .
Conditions for research and development in some emerging markets like China may be surpassing Europe 's , so European companies are transferring some of their investments there .
The Financial Times reported 051010 that in just 5 years China will be spending proportionally more on research and development than the European Union .
EU Commissioner for research Janez Potocnik told the Financial Times that the Chinese trend is extremely clear .
Potocnik said that China will catch up with the EU in 090000 or 100000 if the trend continues .
The Financial Times said research and development investment in China was 1.31 percent of GDP in 030000 but is rising at a double - digit rate .
The Financial Times said that at present growth rates , the EU 's public and private spending on research and development is set to rise from 1.93 percent of gross domestic product in 030000 to 2.2 percent in 100000 .
This is well short of the 3 percent target agreed by EU heads of government as part of the 020000 Lisbon Strategy .
Potocnik was quoted as saying that the conditions for research and development in some emerging markets like China are improving and it is obvious that European companies are transferring some of their investments there .
Potocnik is worried about Europe 's unfavorable research and development environment ranging from excessive red tape to insufficient corporate tax incentives and continued divergences in intellectual property protection and patenting .
In response to the research and development boom in countries such as China and India , the EU government will this week table new proposals to help retain and attract research funding in the EU .
An EU government plan to double the EU 's own research and development budget to 70 billion euro over 060000-110000 was shelved in June amid a dispute among EU leaders over future EU funding .

Deadly attacks in India continue despite deaths of Pakistani Kashmir rebels and destruction of group infrastructure due to earthquake .
There is conflicting opinion as to the extent of damage suffered by the insurgency .
Rebel fighting continues despite losses suffered by Islamic rebels in Pakistan - ruled Kashmir in the massive earthquake .
The Indian government is attempting to assess the extent of losses suffered by rebels .
Police stated that on 18 October 2005 2 militants entered the fortified Srinagar home of junior Education Minister Ghulam Nabi lone of the People 's Democratic Party ( PDF ) and shot him to death .
2 policemen and 1 of the attackers also died and 5 others were injured in the gunfight .
The attack occurred less than 1 day after suspected rebels shot and killed a prominent communist politician in Indian Kashmir .
The daily violence has continued despite a ceasefire declaration in areas affected by the 08 October 2005 earthquake .
The violence that has occurred since the earthquake has been attributed to an umbrella group of separatists called the United Jihad Council .
Some insurgents have joined relief efforts .
The Indian military has not reacted to insurgents ' relief efforts and has continued counter - insurgency operations .
The army states that while it directs aid work it has also killed more than 30 militants since the earthquake .
Federal Intelligence agencies have been working to assess the damage to insurgents in and around Muzaffarabad .
Muzaffarabad is the militants ' headquarters and the capital of Pakistani Kashmir .
Army chief General J. J. Singh stated --
The epicenter of the 7.6 - magnitude earthquake was in Muzaffarabad and caused damage among the militant groups .
All the terrorist infrastructure in and around Muzaffarabad was destroyed and many innocent people died .
It is premature to state with certainty what impact the earthquake has had on the militant groups as infrastructure remains intact in other areas in Pakistan .
The militant groups are seeking either independence for Kashmir or absorption into Pakistan .
Over 1300 people in Indian Kashmir and 41000 people in Pakistan were killed in the earthquake .
The Indian government accuses the Pakistani government of training , arming and funding the Islamic rebellion .
The Pakistani government denies this charge but states that it does extend moral , political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists .
Head of military operations in Indian Kashmir Brigadier Madan Gopal expressed confidence on 17 October 2005 that many of the militants had been killed .
Gopal stated that the Hizbul Mujahedin and the Lashkar - e - Toiba have suffered major losses in the earthquake on the Pakistani side .
Hizbul Mujahedin and Lashkar - e - Toiba are groups that carry out frequent attacks .
Violence continues despite conflicting opinion on the extent of damage suffered by the rebel groups .
Retired General V. N. Sharma rejects suggestions that the earthquake has critically damaged the core of the insurgency .
Sharma was India 's army chief when the insurgency erupted in 1989 .
Sharma states that such suggestions are unrealistic .
Sharma states that he does not think the insurgency has been destroyed because the groups are mobile units and live in tented accommodations .
Sharma states that the destruction of a few communications centers or sub - command posts has little affect on the Greater organization .
Approximately 44000 people have died in the insurgency .
Head of the Military - funded Institute of Defense studies and analysis in New Delhi Uday Bhaskar also warned against complacency stating that loss of firepower and manpower is unimportant .
Bhaskar stated that the militants will soon regroup because they are highly motivated and believe they can achieve their goal of freeing Kashmir from Indian control with violence .
The Indian government is also taking a cautious approach .
Indian Defense Minister Pranab Mukherjee on 17 October 2005 called for vigilance along the 430 - mile de facto border which divides the two Kashmirs .
Mukherjee stated --
Militants have attempted to infiltrate Indian Kashmir approximately 5 times since 08 October 2005 including twice on a single day .
Some of the militants wanted to take advantage of the unstable situation in the region .
The presence of civilians among the troops on relief work could help militants cross the de facto border .
There could be more infiltration attempts next week before winter snow blocks the mountain passes .

During a 4 - day tour of France Chinese Prime Minister Wen states that French company Areva must improve its offer for a nuclear reactor deal with regard to price and technology transfer .
Wen also signed a deal to initiate student exchange programs and attempted to allay anxiety about China 's rapidly growing power .
On 06 December 2005 Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao stated that in order to win a contract to build third - generation nuclear reactors in China France must improve its offer in terms of both cost and transfers of technology .
Wen was speaking on the 3rd day of a 4 - day visit to France .
On a tour of the elite Polytechnique Science University in the southern suburbs of Paris Wen stated that China hopes France will offer more attractive conditions on technology transfer as well as price so that Franco - Chinese cooperation in this field can develop .
The French company Areva is bidding for an 8 billion U.S. dollar ( 6.8 billion euro ) deal to construct 4 reactors in China as are U.S. company Westinghouse and Russian company atomstroyexport .
The bidding among the 3 companies has been competitive .
China was to have announced a winner by the end of 2005 but has delayed its decision until early next year hoping to elicit better terms from the bidders .
On 05 December 2005 during the 4 - day visit to France a Chinese order for 150 medium - range A 320 airliners from the European consortium Airbus was announced .
Airbus also signed a protocol that could lead to aircraft being constructed in China .
Prime Minister Wen held talks in Paris with French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and French President Jacques Chirac and was then to depart the afternoon of 06 December 2005 to Marseille to visit the headquarters of the helicopter manufacturer Eurocopter .
On 05 December 2005 Eurocopter announced a 600 million Euro partnership deal with China to share development and production of a new 16 - seat aircraft called the ec175 .
Wen is scheduled to visit the site of the future experimental nuclear fusion reactor ITER in which China is a partner .
On 07 December 2005 Wen is scheduled to tour the space - satellite facility of telecommunications company Alcatel in Cannes .
Wen departs on 07 December 2005 for Slovakia , the Czech Republic and Portugal .
1 of the reasons for Wen 's visit to the 200 year - old Polytechnique at palaiseau was to sign a partnership deal with three Chinese universities that will introduce new exchange programs and shared qualifications .
Wen stated --
The dynamic young students represented the future of the world .
Student exchanges are more important than the purchase of 150 Airbus .
At present there is economic cooperation between China and France but with such programs in the future there will be cultural cooperation .
In a speech to students , professors and business leaders , Wen attempted to allay anxiety in Europe that China 's fast - growing economic power is a threat to the rest of the world .
Wen stated that because China suffered so much from foreign invasions it understands the value of peace .
Wen stated that for China to choose peace is logical given its history and culture .
China 's development is not a threat but an opportunity for the world .
The French have expressed fear that China 's low costs and poor standards of social security are attracting economic activity and causing increased unemployment in Europe but Wen argued that growing domestic demand in China will eventually lead to new opportunities for foreign exporters .
France views China as a strategic ally in its pursuit of a multipolar world that is not dominated by the U.S. though trade relations between France and China remain low .
France ranks 15th among suppliers to China providing only 1.4 percent of China 's foreign needs .

China said on February 1 , 2007 it did not want an arms race in space .
China did not comment on Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe 's claims that China 's satellite - destroying test had broken international law .
China 's Foreign Ministry refused to react directly to Abe 's comments that Beijing had violated an International Space Treaty when it shot down one of its own satellites with a missile on January 11 , 2007 .
Spokeswoman Jiang Yu said China had already stated China 's position .
Many other countries are concerned about the peaceful uses of outer space .
The countries oppose the weaponization of space and an arms race in space .
China wants them to make common efforts to realize this goal .
Abe said to the Japanese parliament on January 31 , 2007 that Abe believed China 's test was not in compliance with basic international rules such as the Outer Space Treaty .
The 1967 UN treaty bans weapons of mass destruction in space and said that all nations should avoid contamination of space and be held liable for any damage caused .
The United States is concerned that debris from the Chinese test could damage satellites or the manned international space station .
Jiang Yu said she was not aware of the specific information concerning space debris .
Yu insisted that China would be a force for peace and stability .

China said it had the right to carry out the test after destroying the satellite .
The United States and the then Soviet Union are the only other nations to have carried similar tests .

Authorizing of EU sanctions against North Korea meets difficulties due to Britain 's disagreement with Spain over the sovereignty of Gibraltar .
Diplomatic sources said on 070208 that EU sanctions against North Korea cannot go forward due to Britain 's disagreement with Spain over the sovereignty of Gibraltar inhibiting Gibraltar 's Chief Secretary from being listed as one of the required competent authorities .
The European Union decided in 061100 to ban the export of arms and nuclear and missile technology as well as luxury products in compliance with the UN resolution number 1718 adopted after Pyongyang carried out nuclear tests in 061000 .
The EU also introduced restrictions of entry to the EU for individuals deemed to be aiding North Korea 's programs for nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .
Before the measures are applied , the legal sanctions document requires a list of authorities , banks and other bodies in each Member State which would supervise compliance with the sanctions and freeze assets .
British spokeswoman Vicky Courtney in Brussels said Britain insisted that Gibraltar 's Chief Secretary be listed as the competent authority as had done on previous occasions without Spain making any complaint .
Gibraltar 's Chief Secretary acts as the link between the gibraltan government and the British government and Governor .
Another diplomatic source , said the Spanish government was afraid that any mention of a gibraltan authority would constitute a precedent in relations between the EU and Gibraltar and so opposed the move this time .
The Government of Spain insists that Britain should be named in the annex to the document but not Gibraltar .
The Spanish Government refuses to afford any international legitimacy to Gibraltar .
The UK and Spain are seeking to reach a formula which would satisfy both sides .
The 2 EU nations have thus far failed to do so .
Courtney said there is some frustration with the fact that the sanctions are being held up .
Courtney added that it is important to find a constructive solution applicable to this and other documents in future and said that the application of other sanctions also runs the risk of being blocked .
Other EU - levied sanctions include those against Iran over the Iranian nuclear program .
Gibraltar was ceded in perpetuity to Britain by Spain under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht , however Madrid still claims sovereignty .
Gibraltarians in 020000 overwhelmingly rejected moves by Britain and Spain to move towards joint sovereignty for Gibraltar and Gibraltar 's 30000 inhabitants .

Kadhafi warns that US and Britain 's failure to compensate Libya for nuclear disarmament will deter Iran and North Korea from disarming .
20070302 Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi stated in an interview published on the BBC website --
Britain , the EU and the US have not invested in Libya following the country 's abandonment of its nuclear weapons program .
Western countries ' failure to sufficiently compensate Libya will deter Iran and North Korea from disarming .
Other countries should emulate Libya 's example but the example has been destroyed because the US and Britain did not fulfill their promises .
Kadhafi stated --
Libya may still cooperate with Western countries for mutual benefit .
The lack of foreign support will not cause Libya to return to hostile pursuits .
Kadhafi spoke with the BBC from the 30th anniversary celebration of Libya 's Jamahiriyah ( State of the masses ) political system in Sebha .
In 2003 Kadhafi normalized Libya 's relations with Britain , France and the US by pledging to abandon attempts to develop nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction .
Kadhafi had been widely condemned by the international community in previous decades due to opposition to Western countries and alleged support of terrorism .

Australia 's Foreign Minister warns of continuing terrorist threats despite efforts against militants .
Australia 's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer warned 070305 in opening remarks at a counter - terrorism conference Jakarta that terrorists continue to find new recruits and launch attacks despite the foiling of some plots and the jailing of militants .
Indonesia and Australia are co - hosting a 2 - day meeting in Indonesia 's capital attended by the foreign ministers of Malaysia , Thailand and the Philippines and a senior minister from Singapore .
Downer said terrorists are still at large despite terrorist plots having been foiled , terrorists having been captured and prosecuted and terrorist networks having been disrupted .
Downer said that terrorists ' methods and abilities become more sophisticated even as Governments ' capacity to stop them improves .
Indonesia 's Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda said terrorists must not be stopped at the expense of democratic principles .
Wirajuda said terrorists must be stopped without resorting to repressive and undemocratic measures like the violation of human rights or disregard of due process of law .
Wirajuda added that terrorists had been evolving new strategies and tactics and thus are becoming an even greater threat to peace , security and progress .
Wirajuda stated there was a need for better ways of denying terrorists access to weapons of mass destruction and that more effective ways of denying the terrorists access to deadly weapons and especially weapons of great killing power must be devised .
Wirajuda said that vigilance and innovative measures were key to an adequate response to the terrorist threat .
Downer hoped the countries at the meeting could agree on cooperation to stop terrorists acquiring unconventional weapons and to improve law enforcement , intelligence sharing and the response to attacks causing mass casualties .
The Jakarta conference follows an earlier counter - terrorism meeting in Bali in 040200 attended by ministers from 20 Southeast Asian and Pacific countries .
A series of terror attacks have hit Indonesia .
The most recent attack was a triple suicide bombing in the resort island Bali in 050000 that killed 20 bystanders .

Peace activists from Greenpeace climbed a crane on the River Thames outside Britain 's houses of parliament and called MPs to campaign against Prime Minister Tony Blair 's plans to renew the UK 's nuclear deterrent .
Peace activists climbed a crane on the River Thames outside Britain 's houses of parliament on 070313 to campaign against Prime Minister Tony Blair 's plans to renew the UK 's nuclear deterrent .
4 protesters from Greenpeace clambered an estimated 200 feet up the maintenance crane moored on the river and unfurled a banner suggesting Blair loved weapons of mass destruction .
Greenpeace said in a statement that the activists scaled the structure at about 6:00 am GMT and were phoning and attempting to persuade members of parliament ( MP ) to vote against the government .
A Greenpeace spokesman said the 4 volunteers aim to occupy the crane until the vote takes place and hope to telephone as many MPs as possible urging rejection of new weapons of mass destruction .
Lawmakers in the UK parliament 's lower House of Commons are to debate and vote on 070314 whether to back Blair 's controversial 38 - billion - dollar plan to replace the US - built Trident missile system .
Nuclear weapons are still a divisive issue in Blair 's governing Labour Party as unilateral nuclear disarmament was once official labour policy in the 800000 .
Many traditionalists accuse Blair of stifling debate on the subject and claim Trident is a costly and obsolete relic of the cold war and is no longer required .
Deputy Leader of the Commons Nigel Griffiths resigned on 070312 so as to be able to vote against Blair 's government and was joined on 070313 by junior health department aide Jim Devine .
A widespread rebellion from rank - and - file Labour lawmakers is widely predicted .
A BBC Radio poll on 070311 said 64 out of the 101 Labour MPs whom were asked expressed opposition to Blair 's plans .
A further 15 Labour MPs were undecided .
22 backed the proposals .
Lobby group the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ( CND ) on 070313 said 62 Labour MPs and a total of 105 MPs overall had signed an amendment to the vote calling for more time to discuss the issue .
Blair is not expected to lose the vote but will have to rely on the support of the main opposition Conservative Party .
The conservatives broadly back Blair 's plans for a new submarine - based weapons system .

The UN General Assembly on 070315 endorsed UN Secretary - General Ban Ki - moon 's proposal to reform 2 UN core activities peacekeeping and disarmament .
The General Assembly adopted by consensus a restructuring of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations ( DPKO ) involving a split into 2 separate entities for peacekeeping operations .
A Department of peace operations will be tasked with strategy and day - to - day direction and management .
A separate Department of field support will consolidate the support functions of UN field personnel , procurement and financial management .
France 's Jean - Marie Guehenno is the current head of DPKO and will stay on as chief of the future dpo .
The General Assembly also approved Ban 's plan to establish an Office of Disarmament Affairs ( ODA ) to replace the current Department of Disarmament Affairs .
The Secretary General has dismissed suggestions that turning the Disarmament Department into an office signified de - emphasis and said the office would instead report directly to the UN Secretary - General and would ensure access and more frequent interaction .
Developing countries have criticized the larger Powers on disarmament and specifically for failing to reduce nuclear arsenals while insisting on non - proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction .
Ban announced plans soon after taking office on 070101 to reform the UN 's sprawling peacekeeping operations and tighten control over disarmament matters .
The peacekeeping and disarmament reforms were strongly backed by Western countries and faced initial resistance from developing countries .
This resistance prompted ban to launch a process of consultations with the General Assembly to explain the ideas for reform .

The UN Security Council on 070323 was holding frantic talks to try to reach consensus on a draft text broadening UN sanctions against Iran .
Russian delegates were offering compromise language on an amendment calling for a nuclear - free Middle East .
The 15 UN Security Council members met behind closed doors early 070323 to put the finishing touches to a amended text submitted 070322 by the text 's 3 sponsors Britain , France and Germany .
They were to meet again later 070323 to consider an amendment requested by Indonesia and Qatar for insertion of a paragraph into the draft on the goal of establishing a Middle East free from weapons of mass destruction and all missiles for their delivery .
Diplomats said the United States was opposed to the inclusion of this paragraph .
The Russian delegation offered compromise language stating that a solution to the Iranian nuclear issue would contribute to global non - proliferation efforts as well as those in the Middle East .
Qatar 's UN ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser said the Security Council would discuss some amendments raised by Qatar , Indonesia and South Africa and expressed hope that a consensus could be reached .

An Indonesian official says Indonesia agreed to further UN sanctions against Iran over the disputed atomic program because the sanctions promote the goal of a nuclear weapons - free Middle East .
Indonesia 's Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda said on 070326 that Muslim - majority Indonesia agreed to further UN sanctions against Iran over the Iranian government 's disputed atomic program because the sanctions promote the goal of a nuclear weapons - free Middle East .
Wirajuda said the Indonesian government was supporting implementation of a nuclear weapons - free zone in the Middle East and pointed out that Israel is the only country in the Middle East which possesses nuclear weapons .
A clause which emphasized that resolving the Iranian nuclear issue would help to realize the objective of a Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction was included in the sanctions resolution at the request of Indonesia and Qatar .
Some commentators have criticized Indonesia for backing the sanctions because such a stance could diminish Indonesia 's standing among Muslim nations .
Wirajuda said the proposition introduced in the UN resolution for a nuclear weapons - free zone in the Middle East is supported by Arabic countries .
The resolution was passed unanimously on 070324 after days of hard bargaining by the Security Council 's 15 members .
Indonesia currently holds one of the Council 's rotating seats .
The sanctions block all Iranian arms exports and freeze the overseas assets of 28 additional officials and institutions linked to Iran 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and restrict financial aid or loans to the Iranian government while setting a new 60 - day deadline for the Iranian government to comply with UN demands or face further appropriate measures .
The Iranian government reacted angrily and expressed intent to restrict cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog IAEA in retaliation .

Japan on March 27 , 2007 deployed troops to Nepal to monitor Nepal 's ceasefire .
This was the first military mission since Japan created a full - fledged Defense Ministry .
Officially Japan is a pacifist nation .
A Defense Ministry official said that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe 's cabinet decided at a meeting to dispatch six soldiers to Nepal to observe arms control for a year .
Japan will help monitor weapons and soldiers under the peace accord that ended Nepal 's decade - long Maoist insurgency .
Nepal is in the Himalayas .
Japan is a major donor to Nepal .
Japan was forced by the United States to renounce its right to armed forces after World War II and has been slowly expanding its military operations overseas .
Japan created a full - fledged Defense Ministry in January 2007 for the first time since 1945 .
Japan upgraded the former defense agency which was lower in rank than cabinet - level ministries .
Abe 's conservative government also listed overseas peacekeeping activities as a mission for Japan 's military because of the change .
They are known as the self - defense forces .
Deployments abroad had been previously considered extraordinary and led the Government to seek parliamentary approval .
Defense Minister Fumio Kyuma told reporters that this is the first time Japan will deploy the Self - Defense Force abroad since peacekeeping became one of the main missions for the troops .
Kyuma said that Japan has to pay careful attention to the security .
Japan sent 600 troops in its most prominent deployment to Iraq on a reconstruction mission .
The soldiers returned last year without suffering any casualties or firing a shot .

The EU froze the assets abroad of some North Korean officials .
The EU banned exports to the country of luxury goods like caviar , truffles , high - quality wines and perfumes and pure bred horses .
The bloc supported UN resolution 1718 in November .

The decision was delayed by an argument between Britain and Spain concerning the method in which Gibraltar would implement the measures .
The resolution was passed after the North Korean government announced that it had performed its first nuclear weapons test on October 9 , 2006 .
The announcement triggered world - wide outrage .

Illegal arms trafficking increases in Kenya due to easy availability and neighboring conflicts .
Government initiatives to disarm have been ineffective .
Illegal arms trafficking has increased in Kenya and raised concern about security .
Daniel kiptugen of Oxfam stated that there are approximately 140,000 illegal arms in circulation in Kenya among the most vulnerable and marginalized groups .
Illegal weapons are easily procured in urban open - air markets despite a government initiative launched in 2006 to curb the availability of arms .
Kenyan security minister John Michuki recently stated at a ceremony burning 8000 illegal arms seized in 2006 to prevent the spread of firearms --
Firearms fuel the illegal exploitation of natural resources and abet terrorism and other crimes .
The easy affordability and accessibility of arms reduces incentives to pursue non - violent solutions to conflicts and initiates a spiral of insecurity .
Police stated that conflicts along Kenya 's borders have increased the number of weapons in the area .
Conflicts include a 20 - year insurgency in Uganda , anarchy in Somalia since 1991 and the former civil war in Sudan .
Police spokesman Gideon kibunjah stated --
Kenya has always experienced serious arms trafficking but the free sale of arms in Somalia presents an additional problem .
Weapons smuggling has increased since 20061200 when Ethiopian - Somali troops eradicated an Islamist movement from south and central Somalia .
Mogadishu experienced chaos and arms control at the border with Kenya became a low - priority issue .
Kenya has participated since 2000 in a regional treaty to control and reduce the number of illegal arms in the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa but has achieved limited success in disarmament .
Kiptugen stated --
The impact of government disarmament programs had not yet been apparent .
Forced disarmament process has never been successful because it fails to address the impetus of the demand : competition for natural resources and a lack of government security forces .
Pastoral communities in northern Kenya frequently resolve tribal conflicts concerning water and land access by gun battles .
Communities consider guns a means of self - protection and protection of the community 's livelihood .
Gun Control activist Walter Odhiambo stated that increased economic inequity in Kenya is a catalyst for violence .
2/3 of the population subsists on under 1 dollar per day .
The Kenyan government has increased promises to augment security measures before President Mwai Kibaki contends for re - election in 20071200 .
The US issued a travel advisory to US citizens warning of increasing incidents of violent crime after 2 Americans were shot and killed in Kenya in 20070100 .
Kenya has struggled to overcome a reputation of high crime rates and frequent terrorist threats after the country experienced deadly terrorist attacks in 1998 and 2002 , ongoing tribal conflicts and a crime wave that killed 50 in 20070100 .
Kenya was previously considered relatively stable compared to surrounding countries in the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa ridden with regional conflicts .

Thailand 's Defense Ministry has decided to develop and produce rockets and missiles .
Jane 's Defence Weekly reported on 070412 that the Thai Government has decided to develop and produce rockets and missiles in a radical shift towards building an indigenous defense industry .
Jane 's said the program would lift Thailand beyond the current capacity for producing explosives , ammunition and small arms under licence as well as modernizing and repairing aircraft and armored vehicles .
The Thai armed forces do not currently have any surface - to - surface missiles in their inventory .
Jane 's cited an internal Thai Defense Ministry document which said Thailand will start by developing a multiple - launch rocket ( MLR ) with a range of 80 kilometers ( 48 miles ) .
Jane 's said there is already a project underway to develop a 160 millimeter MLR with a 40 - kilometer range and that other projects include a strategic rocket with turbojet engine guided by Global Position System and inertial navigation system .
The Thai Ministry document says funding pressures on the defense budget and encouragement by unspecified sectors for greater self - sufficiency is driving the new program .
Such a rocket is significant because of the implication of efforts to develop a surface - to - surface missile with a range at the upper limit of the voluntary Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) .
The MTCR is a global disarmament group involving the United States and 33 other members and was established in 870000 to control exports of missiles which can deliver weapons of mass destruction .
Thailand 's King bhumipol Adulyadej enjoys strong support from the armed forces which overthrew the Thai government in a bloodless coup in 060900 and has called for a sufficiency economy .
Jane 's added that the new research and development program was launched before the coup but gained formal approval upon submission to the country 's Defense Council about a month afterwards .

Members of Egypt 's opposition Muslim Brotherhood on trial in Egyptian military court including high - ranking businessman thought to fund the Organization .
Defense lawyers boycotted the closed - door session arguing that they had not been made aware of the trial dates .
A judicial source stated that approximately 40 members of Egypt 's opposition movement Muslim Brotherhood went on trial at a military court on 26 April 2007 charged with belonging to a banned organization and funding terrorism .
Defense lawyers boycotted the closed - door session arguing that they had not been made aware of the dates of the Tribunal .
Family members were initially banned from the proceedings but were eventually permitted entrance .
Family members stated that the defendants remained silent during proceedings because their counsel was not present .
Journalists , family members and diplomatic observers have been allowed into the courtroom for past military trials of Islamists .
The courtroom is at a military base in the desert outside Cairo .
The session on 26 April 2007 was approximately 4 hours in duration and was adjourned until 03 June 2007 .
Defendants included Khayrat Al-Shater who ranks number 3 in the hierarchy of the Muslim Brotherhood .
As part of the Government 's repression of Egypt 's largest opposition bloc Al-Shater was arrested in December 2006 following a university demonstration in which masked pro - Brotherhood students staged a military - style parade on the campus of Al-Azhar University in the capital city Cairo .
Al-Shater and other businessmen linked to the group had their assets frozen and were referred to a military court in February 2007 .
The targeting of Al-Shater and other businessmen associated with the movement has been considered an attempt to disable the Organization financially .
Egyptian authorities accuse the movement of seeking to reactivate its underground military wing with the aim of eventually overthrowing the regime .
The Muslin Brotherhood controls a fifth of the seats in Parliament .
The Government of Egypt began using military courts to try members of the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamic groups in the 1990s when they were not being convicted by civilian courts .
Under a law passed by Parliament last week the verdicts of military courts can now be appealed .

A conference of the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) will begin on 30 April 2007 in Vienna .
Experts stated the preparatory session can not change the treaty but is expected to focus on problems in fighting proliferation and in getting the 5 original nuclear weapons states to fulfill the NPT commitment to disarm .
A conference on the world 's nuclear non - proliferation treaty ( NPT ) against the spread of nuclear weapons opens on 30 April 2007 in Vienna .
The meeting will take place through 14 May 2007 and is the 1st of a series of Preparatory Committee sessions ahead of the next overall review in 2010 .
The NPT went into effect at the height of the Cold War in 1970 and was extended indefinitely in 1995 .
The NPT has 188 signatory States and is a deal in which nuclear weapons States agree to disarm while nations without the bomb agree not to seek the bomb .
The NPT is reviewed every 5 years .
The meeting in May 2005 failed to resolve any key questions due to an agenda disagreement between non - aligned countries and nuclear powers .
The NPT Conference occurs as --
The crisis over Iran 's atomic program escalates though Iran has not yet produced atomic bombs .
A deal to dismantle North Korea 's nuclear program which has produced atomic bombs has stalled .
A U.S. strategy to use pre - emptive force if judged necessary and Britian 's nuclear arsenal upgrade threaten the NPT .
Experts stated the NPT is ill adapted to the modern era in which so - called rogue States seek to acquire a nuclear weapons capacity by 1st developing peaceful programs under the terms of the treaty .
Experts stated that fixes should include tougher UN inspections and automatic penalties for countries who drop out of the treaty .
The North Korean government withdrew from the NPT in 2003 after expelling United Nations inspectors .
The North Korean government tested an atomic bomb in October 2006 .
The Iranian government justifies nuclear work under article IV of the NPT which guarantees the inalienable right to develop research , production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
U.S. government stated that the Iranian government uses article IV as a cover for the secret development of nuclear weapons which the Treaty bans .
Non - proliferation analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington George perkovich stated the NPT is the most effective treaty in history and referred to the fact that predictions made in the 1960s that there would soon be 30-40 nuclear weapons States have not come to pass .
There are believed to be 9 nuclear weapons states .
The States are the 5 allowed under the NPT , Britain , China , France , Russia and the United States .
The States also include North Korea which withdrew from the treaty and 3 nuclear states including India , Pakistan and Israel which have refused to sign the NPT .
Diplomats and experts stated the preparatory session can not change the treaty but is expected to focus on problems in fighting proliferation and in getting the 5 original nuclear weapons states to fulfill the NPT commitment to disarm which is a focus of non - aligned States .
Nuclear and disarmement expert Rebecca Johnson wrote the week of 22 April 2007 on Johnson 's Acronym Institute website that the risk of nuclear proliferation is too grave for the international community to shirk responsibilities and that the NPT has already begun to unravel .
Felicity Hill of the non - governmental organization the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons ( ican ) stated to AFP that the meeting could build towards a successful 2010 Review Conference but progress must occur on both non - proliferation and disarmament .
A diplomat in Vienna who closely follows the non - proliferation regime stated that expectations are being lowered for a successful outcome to the Preparatory Committee given the inauspicious international developments and the growing detritus of arms control agreements cast aside .

On 21 May 2007 the Government of Estonia rejected European Union criticism of its handling of recent cyber attacks .
Estonia has experienced a series of cyber attacks since the end of April 2007 that have forced it to restrict access to many State websites .
Estonia is a Baltic State member of the European Union .
Hillar aarelaid is head of Estonia 's computer emergency response team cert .
Aarelaid was responding to comments made by Jacqueline McGlade .
McGlade is head of the EU agency that promotes a shared network of environmental data .
Aarelaid stated that McGlade 's assertion that Estonia should have employed basic procedures such as firewalls to defend from cyber attack demonstrated ignorance of the extent of the cyber assaults on Estonia .
Aarelaid stated to the AFP by phone on 21 May 2007 that if the solution had been as simple as using elementary firewalls that Estonia would have done it .
At a press conference in Geneva McGlade had stated that the EU agency she heads firmly believes that to react to cyber attack by closing systems down is unsound .
Estonia began barring access to key government and some private websites 3 weeks ago after the onset of a series of cyber attacks against Estonia .
Many of the attacks originated abroad .
The cyber attacks were triggered by Estonian government authorities ' decision to remove a Soviet war memorial from central Tallinn .
This decision angered Russia and the large ethnic Russian minority in Estonia .
Officials in Estonia including Prime Minister andrus Ansip have claimed that some of the cyber attacks came from Russian government computers including computers in the office of Russian President Vladimir Putin .
Aarelaid stated to AFP --
Critics of Estonia 's response may not be aware that traffic on some Estonian sites was increased by 1 million .
Imposing temporary restrictions on Internet traffic from abroad was inevitable .
Mcglade 's comments on the Estonian response were made in Geneva ahead of a United Nations conference on global access to information technology .
Mcglade stated that attacks on State and private websites should be handled in a systematic way instead of by restricting access .
Mcglade stated that there are technologies that the EU agency deploys in an effort to avoid restricting access to government websites .
The EU Agency will be in contact with the Estonian Government to advise on possible defense measures .
Estonia is a world pioneer in IT solutions .
Estonia ranks higher than the 15 older EU members and just behind the United States on a World Bank list of countries that are advanced in preparing for a knowledge - based society .
Aarelaid stated --
Access to critical websites was never restricted .
Estonia is prepared to keep critical websites accessible in any situation but that during a massive cyber attack some websites like that of the Estonian Agriculture Ministry are of a lower priority to keep accessible to visitors from abroad .

Republic of Korea launches its first Aegis destroyer equipped with advanced air and sea defenses .
Japanese and Chinese naval buildups and the threat from the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea have caused Republic of Korea to expand its defense and combat capabilities .
On 25 May 2007 the Republic of Korea launched its first Aegis destroyer equipped with advanced air and sea defenses .
The Republic of Korea faces Japanese and Chinese naval buildups and a potential threat from the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea .
The KDX - III destroyer weighs 7600 tons .
The navy stated that the Republic of Korea is the 5th country to have a destroyer equipped with the Aegis integrated weapons control system following the United States , Japan , Spain and Norway .
The destroyer was built domestically at a cost of 1 billion U.S. dollars .
President Roh Moo - hyun stated at a launching ceremony that the ship is armed with a state - of - the - art defense system and combat capability and is one of the world 's best destroyers .
Roh stated that Republic of Korea will move forward with a program to create an ocean - going navy .
The destroyer is named the King Sejong after the monarch who helped create the Korean alphabet in the 15th century .
The navy said in a statement --
The King Sejong has integrated capabilities in broad - range air defense , support for ground operations , automatic tracking and destruction of enemy aircraft and guided and ballistic missiles .
The new destroyer is expected to greatly increase combat capabilities .
A 2nd Aegis destroyer will be launched in 2010 and a 3rd in 2012 in what a navy spokesman stated in May 2007 was an attempt to rival the naval powers of Japan and China .
The Republic of Korea faces a potential threat from the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea around their contested maritime border in the Yellow Sea .
This week the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea accused the Republic of Korea of dispatching warships to violate its territorial waters .
6 South Koreans were killed in June 2002 in battles in the area .
In June 1999 dozens of North Korean sailors were killed in a similar battle .
The Aegis combat system was built by the U.S. firm Lockheed Martin .
The Aegis combat system allows a ship to combat multiple surface , underwater and aerial targets .
The King Sejong is also equipped with locally developed ship - to - ship missiles and torpedoes as well as various ship - to - air missiles and ship - to - surface cruise missiles .
Stealth technology was used in building the King Sejong making radar detection more difficult .
The ship will be deployed operationally in 2009 .
The Republic of Korea is cooperating with Germany to build 1800 - ton modern submarines .
A second such submarine will be launched in early June 2007 .

Russia tests new multiple warhead missile capable of penetrating air - defense systems such as the U.S. shield planned for deployment in central Europe .
In response to U.S. plans Putin states that Russia will suspend its compliance with a European conventional weapons control treaty as Russia continues working to regain military parity with the U.S. .
On 29 May 2007 Russia stated it had successfully tested a new multiple warhead ballistic missile designed to overcome air - defense systems such as the U.S. shield planned for deployment in Central Europe .
Russia 's strategic missile forces issued a statement saying that the RS - 24 rocket was fired from the northeastern Arkhangelsk region and hit its target on the Kamchatka Peninsula 6000 kilometers away .
The Kamchatka peninsula protrudes into the Pacific Ocean .
According to the statement the RS - 24 reinforces the military potential of the strategic forces to overcome anti - missile defense systems .
The test occurred amidst Russia 's diplomatic battle over U.S. plans to expand a missile defense shield into Central Europe .
The Russian Government considers the U.S. plan an attempt to gain nuclear power in the region .
First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov is a former defense minister and widely considered a potential successor to President Vladimir Putin in 2008 .
Ivanov stated that the RS - 24 could overcome any anti - missile system like that of the United States .
Ivanov was quoted by Interfax as stating that the Russian missile complexes are capable of penetrating all existing and prospective anti - missile systems .
Ivanov stated that Russians should be confident in the nation 's defense and security capabilities .
The United States states that the planned radar base in the Czech Republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighboring Poland would defend Europe against potential threats from Iran and North Korea and pose no threat to Russia .
President Vladimir Putin disagrees and stated that Russia is suspending compliance with a European conventional weapons control treaty .
Putin warned that a new arms race is possible .
According to the statement the new rocket meets the standards of START - II missile treaties which impose restrictions on the use of multiple warhead missiles .
A spokesman for the strategic forces stated to the AFP that the missile is new but uses technologies of the Topol - M missile .
According to the statement the prototype RS - 24 rocket is unlike the Topol - M in that it is equipped with multiple independently targetable warheads to overwhelm defense systems .
The Ministry of Defense refused to reveal the characteristics of the new missile other than stating it was designed to replace the Soviet - era RS - 18 and RS - 20 rockets .
Director of the Moscow Center for Defense Information Ivan safranchuk stated --
The RS - 24 is a significant modernization of Topol - M.
The principle advantage is that the RS - 24 is a Russian rocket .
Other multiple warhead missiles that Russia utilized were built in Ukraine .
Prior to the RS - 24 there were no Russian - built multiple warhead missiles .
Military analyst Alexander golts stated that the test was part of a massive effort by the Russian government to regain parity with the United States ' strategic missile forces .
Golts stated that the principle military political aim of the current Russian leadership is to regain parity with the United States .

NATO member States and countries from the former Soviet bloc met in Vienna on 12 June 2007 to re - examine the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe ( CFE ) in light of tensions between Moscow and the West .
The CFE meeting was convened at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and will last until 15 June 2007 .
The Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe was signed in Paris in 1990 and aimed at establishing defense parity in Europe .
The CFE came into force in 1992 and limits deployments of tanks and troops in countries belonging to NATO and the former Warsaw Pact in Eastern Europe .
Chief of the Russian delegation Anatoly Antonov stated in Vienna on 11 June 2007 that Russian officials called the meeting because the Russian Government is unable to freely move Russian troops on Russian territory .
Anotov referred to limitations imposed by the CFE and stated that the choice of which armed forces to deploy belongs to Russian officials .
Russian President Vladimir Putin recently threatened to suspend application of the CFE amid disagreement with the government in Washington over US plans to extend a missile shield into Central Europe .
Russian and U.S. officials have disagreed over the CFE since 1999 with NATO officials stating that Russian officials have failed to honor commitments to withdraw troops from Moldova and Georgia .
Russian officials accuse the United States of a military buildup near Russia 's borders with the US planning new army bases in Romania and Bulgaria as well as the missile shield proposal .
Antonov stated that Russian officials have serious concerns over the plans for military bases .
On 26 April 2007 Putin cited NATO 's lack of movement and called for a freeze on Russian compliance with the CFE which disconcerted Western observers .
Antonov downplayed the idea that Russian officials would pull out of the CFE altogether and stated that the dispute over the US missile shield would not be discussed at the meeting .
Antonov stated that the US plans for military bases in Romania and Bulgaria will be on the meeting 's agenda .
Antonov rejected an offer made by the US and NATO allies to the Russian Government the week of 3 June 2007 to accept a multinational peacekeeping force in the pro - Russian Moldovan separatist region of Transdniestr .

The United Nations said on June 25 , 2007 that sophisticated laboratories inside Afghanistan are converting 90 percent of Afghanistan 's opium into heroin and morphine before smuggling it around the world .
The United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) said Afghanistan is the world 's biggest producer of opium and had exported the illicit drug almost exclusively in its raw form until 2 years ago .
UNODC representative Christina Oguz in Kabul said that she believes the amount of the opium being processed in Afghanistan is approximately 90 percent .
Oguz said that anyone flying over the major opium producing areas would see a lot of small fires in the mountains , which are heroin labs .
Oguz stated that a couple of years ago opium was the primary drug being trafficked out of Afghanistan .
Oguz said there has been an increase of opium being processed into morphine and into heroin and that this indicates sophistication that was not previously present in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan accounts for 92 percent of the world 's heroin supply despite vast internationally - backed efforts to eradicate its opium poppy fields .
Oguz said the annual income from the drugs trade helps finance the Taliban - led insurgency plaguing mainly southern and eastern Afghanistan and that this income totals more than three billion US dollars .
Oguz stated that the drugs have to be fought together with the insurgency .
Afghanistan produced a record 6000 tons of opium in 2006 .
Officials said that the 2007 harvest could exceed the 2006 record because of an increase in opium cultivation in the southern provinces .
Oguz said that favorable weather conditions had also contributed to the increase .
Oguz fears that Afghanistan will have at least the same amount as the 2006 harvest if not more .
Oguz also downplayed international efforts to eradicate poppy crops and said that it was more important to provide poor opium farmers with alternative livelihoods .

Russia 's government announced withdrawal from the Conventional Forces in Europe arms control treaty in hopes that the accompanying uncertainty will pressure European regarding various military , economic , and political issues .
The Russian government announced on 070714 suspension of Russian adherence to the Conventional Forces in Europe ( CFE ) arms control treaty .
The CFE is a key agreement that limits the deployment of forces in central and eastern Europe .
US moves to install anti - missile bases in the region were seen as a key cause of the decision .
Analysts said that it is Europe that is likely to suffer most from the decision 's consequences .
Independent defense analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said the CFE Treaty is much more important to the European countries than the US .
Felgenhauer pointed out that Russia has other problems with Europe and that this withdrawal is another factor reducing confidence and deteriorating relations especially with European countries .
Felgenhauer predicted that actual troop deployments are unlikely to change much and believed the biggest practical effect of Russia 's decision will be an end to mutual inspections and confidence - building measures governed by the Treaty .
Analysts said the hope in the Russian Government is that the uncertainty will weaken European resolve over a number of issues .
Interfax news agency cited Ivan safranchuk of the international center on defense information as saying that the situation will push Europe into a more active position on missile defense .
Europe has largely backed US plans for an anti - missile radar station in the Czech Republic and interceptor rockets in Poland .
The Russian government says the US plans threaten to upset the balance of power on the continent .
Other analysts were doubtful that attempts to pressure the EU would bear fruit .
Editor of the Moscow - based Journal Russia in global affairs Fyodor Lukyanov said the Russian government is hoping that Europe 's extreme unease over this will lead to a softening of Europe 's positions .
Lukyanov thinks the Russian government 's calculations are wrong and that a frightened Europe will join with the United States .
Lukyanov said the decision to freeze the CFE was part of a wider move by the Russian government to use newly found strength to remold the foundations of transatlantic relations and that the Russian government wants to revise the forces influencing interaction in the Euro - Atlantic area that were set when Russia was weaker .
Political analyst and director of Moscow 's Institute for globalization Boris Kagarlitsky said the Russian government also appears to be using its geopolitical strength to put pressure on Europe over business ties .
Kagarlitsky said the withdrawal from the Treaty will be seen in the West as an attempt to put pressure on a number of issues including in the economic sphere .
Disagreements over energy security and a dispute over deliveries of Polish meat have prevented Russian and European Union authorities from agreeing to a new mutual cooperation agreement .
Kagarlitsky said that at some stage the Russian government will put all of the economic issues on the table while expressing doubt whether the Russian government 's goals will be achieved .

In a state of the nation speech in 20070400 Putin stated that Russia should announce a moratorium on adherence to the CFE Treaty until all NATO countries have ratified the Treaty .
Putin appears to particularly target the Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania , former Soviet republics and current NATO members which are not part of the CFE Treaty .
The CFE Treaty limits the deployment of tanks and troops in NATO and former Eastern European Warsaw Pact countries and establishes confidence - building , transparency and cooperation measures between Member States .

The treaty was adapted in Istanbul in 1999 following the collapse of the Warsaw Pact in order to limit deployments on a country - by - country basis .
The CFE is considered a key European post - Cold War security accord .
NATO states have refused to ratify the new pact because Russia has failed to honor commitments made in Istanbul adaptation to withdraw forces from the former Soviet republics of Georgia and Moldova .

Saferworld Team Leader on transfer controls and small arms Roy isbister stated --
The EU embargo prohibits direct or indirect supply of military equipment for use in Myanmar .
The integrity of the arms embargo depends on its implementation and enforcement .

France was criticized over France 's plans to build a nuclear reactor in Libya while nuclear proliferation experts dismissed concerns .
On 070726 France was criticized over France 's plans to build a nuclear reactor in Libya .
Nuclear proliferation experts dismissed concerns that the French - Libyan nuclear reactor deal was tantamount to handing Moamer Kadhafi a nuclear bomb .
An official with France 's Atomic Energy Commission insisted that international safeguards imposed after Libya dissolved the Libyan military nuclear program would prevent any Libyan nuclear proliferation .
Other experts agreed with the with French Atomic Energy Commission official .
Sortir du nucleaire stated that the official reason for the Libyan nuclear reactor was a deception as the civilian and military uses of nuclear technology were indissociable .
The official reason for the Libyan nuclear reactor is to desalinate sea water .
Sortir du nucleaire stated that delivering civilian nuclear energy to Libya would amount to eventually helping Libya to acquire nuclear weapons .
Sortir du nucleaire stated that Libya is rich in oil and gas and Libya is very amply self - sufficient in energy .
Sortir du nucleaire stated that if Libya wishes to diversify Libyan power production than Libya should logically give priority to solar energy because Libya enjoys remarkable levels of sunshine all year long .
A memorandum on building the new nuclear reactor in Libya was signed as French president Nicolas Sarkozy held talks with Libyan leader Muammar Kadhafi on 070725 .
On 070724 the Libyan government freed 6 foreign medics after France and European Union officials had played a key role in the process of securing the release of the 6 foreign medics .
Greenpeace France stated that the French - Libyan nuclear reactor deal poses an enormous problem in terms of nuclear proliferation and branded the French - Libyan nuclear reactor deal as in keeping with the French policy of irresponsible export of nuclear technology .
Greenpeace pointed out that previous French Presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former Shah of Iran , with the former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and with South Africa during the apartheid era .
Frederic marillier stated that the official reason the nuclear reactor is being sold to Libya is to desalinate sea water to improve Libya 's supplies of drinking water .
Frederic marillier stated that Frederic marillier wanted to know who Iran and France thought would believe this reason for building the nuclear reactor .
Frederic marillier is in charge of Greenpeace 's energy campaign .
The French opposition Socialist Party asked if it was not a bit soon to be throwing France into Kadhafi 's arms and giving him France 's international endorsement ?
The French opposition Socialist Party stated that civilian nuclear technology can be used eventually to develop military applications .
The French Green party accused Nicolas Sarkozy of boundless cynicism rooted in the risk of striking a nuclear deal with an undemocratic state .
Simon Nisan stated that the 070726 French - Libyan nuclear reactor deal followed the signature in 060300 of a agreement for bilateral cooperation in nuclear research and technology .
Simon Nisan is a member of France 's Atomic Energy Commission and is in charge of nuclear - powered desalination projects .
The 060300 of a agreement for bilateral cooperation focuses primarily on a nuclear research centre at Tajura whose nuclear reactor was supplied by the Soviet Union in 790000 .
Tajura is near Tripoli .
Simon Nisan stated that International Atomic Energy Agency controls made it almost impossible to divert the nuclear technology to military use .
Simon Nisan stated that the International Atomic Energy Agency controls are so tight that a person does not have the right to remove fuel without the presence of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors .
Simon Nisan stated that the material generated is low - enriched uranium and not highly - enriched uranium which is needed for nuclear bombs .
In 040000 weapons - grade uranium stored at the nuclear research centre in Tajura was removed under International Atomic Energy Agency scrutiny and was sent for recycling to Russia after Muammar Kadhafi pledged to give up weapons of mass destruction in 030000 .
Russia had originally supplied the uranium to Iran .
A diplomat in Vienna that is close with the International Atomic Energy Agency stated that the Libyan Government had had very good cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency since 030000 .
Mark Fitzpatrick in London stated that mark Fitzpatrick saw no proliferation risk for the plans to build a nuclear reactor in Libya because of the fact that Libya is still cooperating with the International Atomic Energy Agency and based on the manner in which Libya turned over and destroyed equipments .
Mark Fitzpatrick is a member of the International Institute for Strategic Studies .
Mark Fitzpatrick stated that Libya 's cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency , the Government of the United Kingdom and the United States Government has been exemplary .
Mark Fitzpatrick stated that it is important for the rest of the world to see that when a country abandons nuclear weapons programs and weapons of mass destruction that there are tangible benefits .
Mark Fitzpatrick stated that this cooperation with France is a direct result of Libya abandoning nuclear weapons programs and weapons of mass destruction .

British newspapers have reported that Chinese military has hacked into British government networks .
China 's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu denies the Chinese Government 's involvement and stated the Chinese government 's willingness to cooperate with the international community during investigations into the hacking attacks .
China 's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu stated on 6 September 2007 that statements that the Chinese military has made cyber attacks on the networks of foreign Governments are groundless and irresponsible and are a result of ulterior motives .
Jiang stated that the Chinese government has opposed and prohibited any cyber crimes and has explicit laws and regulations regarding cyber crimes .
Jiang stated the Chinese government was willing to cooperate with the international community to investigate the alleged attacks but Chinese police have not received any requests from relevant countries on cooperative investigations .
Jiang 's statement responded to news reports carried by The Times and The Independent newspapers in London that Chinese computer hackers had infiltrated British government networks .
The Times quoted an unidentified British government source as stating that the Chinese government was engaged in hostile intelligence activities .
The source stated the Chinese government is focusing on electronic means to hack into systems to discover Britain 's defense and foreign policy secrets instead of using the old - fashioned methods and that the Chinese government is technologically advanced and adept at hacking .
The reports were issued after US President George W. Bush stated that a discussion of the issue of suspected Chinese cyber - attacks on the US Defense Department could occur during a meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao in Sydney on 6 September 2007 .
The Pentagon stated on 4 September 2007 that several nations and groups had been trying to break into the US military 's computer system after the Financial Times reported China 's military had successfully hacked into the network in June 2007 .
On 4 September 2007 Jiang denied the hacking allegation .

The OSCE 's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights ( ODIHR ) defended the decision to boycott citing Russian authorities ' delays in issuing visas and unwarranted restrictions imposed on the OSCE observation mission .
On 26 November 2007 Putin stated that the OSCE had canceled its planned vote monitoring on the recommendation of the U.S. State Department and that the aim is to discredit the elections .
Russia has denied obstructing the observers and has stated the elections will conform with Russian law .
Kazakhstan 's bid to assume the rotating chairmanship of the OSCE in 2009 is expected to be a major topic of discussion at the conference .
Kazakhstan 's bid for the OSCE chairmanship is the first bid from a former Soviet Union nation .
The Government of Kazakhstan has lobbied for the chairmanship arguing it has a stable political situation , multilateral foreign policy and strong economy distinguishing it from other former Soviet countries .
Several OSCE member States have questioned Kazakhstan 's democratic credentials .
Kazakhstan is an oil - rich country .
Head of the Assessment Risks Group in Kazakhstan 's capital Almaty is Dosym Satpayev .
Satpayev stated that Kazakhstan 's chances of winning its bid for the chairmanship were considerably reduced after its last general elections were not recognized as conforming to OSCE standards .
Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev 's political party Nur Otan won all the seats in the parliamentary election held in August 2007 .
The choice of the OSCE chairmanship is made by consensus .
Opposition by 1 country would be enough to deny Kazakhstan the chairmanship .
British newspaper The Financial Times reported on 27 November 2007 that OSCE officials will offer Kazakhstan a deal organized by Spain under which the country would assume the rotating chairmanship in 2010 or 2011 .
OSCE spokeswoman Virginie coulloudon stated that such a deal is 1 scenario among 5 or 6 others .
Kazakhstan 's Foreign Ministry insists the country is still seeking the chairmanship for 2009 .

US experts report Chinese plans to dispatch troops to North Korea and secure North Korea 's nuclear arsenal in the event of instability .
A report compiled by experts from the Center for Strategic and International Studies , the US Institute of Peace and the Asia Foundation stated that China has contingency plans to dispatch Chinese People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) troops to North Korea and secure nuclear weapons in the event of instability in North Korea .
The experts visited China 20070600 to confer with Chinese military researchers .
The report stated --
China 's strong preference is to receive formal authorization and coordinate closely with the UN in any possible intervention .
China would take unilateral action to restore stability if the international community did not react in a timely manner as the internal order in North Korea deteriorated rapidly .
The report stated --
PLA researchers claim that contingency plans exist for the PLA to perform three possible missions in North Korea -- humanitarian , peacekeeping and environmental control .
The environmental control measures are intended to clean up nuclear contamination resulting from a strike on North Korean nuclear facilities near the Sino - North Korean border and to secure nuclear weapons and fissile materials .
The report stated --
China 's main priority in the event of instability in North Korea would be prevention of an influx of refugees by assuring supplies of food and strengthening border controls .

Non - nuclear countries will be difficult to mobilize against Iran if they are treated the same way as Iran .
Some are concerned over the potential risk of supplying nuclear technology to Arab States because the region is unstable and dominated by authoritarian regimes and Islamic extremism .
German energy minister Gernot Erler stated in response to France 's decision to provide nuclear technology to Libya that the risk of proliferation goes up with every country that uses nuclear energy .
French environmentalists stated that Sarkozy is not sufficiently addressing concerns about human rights , the environment and international security .

Iran is suspected of concealing military ambitions of its clandestine nuclear programs and is subject to international sanctions due to refusing to comply with UN demands .

The Government accepts that there were defective aspects of the trials in which the life or health of participants may have been endangered .
The trials were frequently under considerable pressures of time as new threats emerged .
The Government acknowledges the debt Britain owes to the victims of the trials .
The veterans claim to have been informed that they were volunteering for cold remedy tests and have suffered ill - health as a result .
The trials occurred at the government 's military chemical and biological defense research facility at Porton Down in southwest England in the 1950s and 1960s .

UN Office on Drugs and Crime representative Christina Oguz stated that Afghanistan has done little to stop the corruption enabling drug trade and Afghanistan 's institutions are too weak to combat drug trade .
Drug production will be a main focus of a meeting in Tokyo to assess progress in Afghanistan .
UN Office on Drugs and Crime representative Christina Oguz stated that Afghanistan has done little to stop the corruption enabling drug trade and Afghanistan 's institutions are too weak to combat drug trade .
Oguz stated to AFP in an interview that the drug industry in Afghanistan produces more than 90 percent of the world 's illegal opium and that ending the industry in Afghanistan will take decades .
Drug production escalated in 2007 and furthers deteriorating security .
Drug production will be a main focus of ministers , donors and aid agencies meeting in Tokyo on 5 February 2008 through 6 February 2008 to assess progress in Afghanistan .
A paper prepared for the talks said the expansion of the narcotics industry represents the single greatest threat to afghanistan 's stability and is increasingly linked to insecurity and terrorist activities .
The source of the document is the website of the joint coordination and monitoring board ( jcmb ) which is a committee working to implement Afghanistan 's 5 - year reconstruction plan .
The paper said the drug trade funds terrorism , fuels corruption and undermines the rule of law that should bring security to the people of Afghanistan .
The paper said traffickers provide weapons , funding and personnel to anti - government rebels while corrupt officials offer protection of drug trade routes , poppy fields and people .
6 , Oguz stated a focus of the Tokyo talks will be the need for immediate action in lieu of talking .
Oguz stated --
The fact that President Hamid Karzai has not appointed a counternarcotics minister to replace the minister who resigned in July 2008 indicates the priority given to drug production even though Karzai has said drug production is 1 of the most important issues for Afghanistan to tackle .
Very little has been done to fight corruption .
Corruption feeds the industry in that farmers often have to pay a 10 percent tax to Afghan officials or Taliban insurgents .
Farmers must pay various bribes .
Farmers receive less than 1/4 of the 4 billion dollars that annual trade earns which is equal to more than 1/2 of the legal gross domestic product .
No one questions how people have very low salaries but drive in expensive cars and live in expensive houses .
Typically only the couriers are arrested .
Oguz stated bigger criminals are extremely difficult to find .
Some are not living in Afghanistan despite being Afghans .
Afghanistan 's opium is increasingly converted into heroin inside Afghanistan and supplies drug users in Europe , Central Asia and the Middle East .
Oguz stated blaming Afghanistan for the world 's heroin problem would be unfair as heroin production is a shared responsibility .
Chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin come primarily from the developed world and are illegally sent to Afghanistan .
Oguz stated the national strategy to deal with the drugs trade should be tailored to the different circumstances in the 34 provinces .
13 provinces were declared opium - free in 2007 which is double the figure from 2006 .
Oguz stated --
The focus should be on interdiction in southern Afghanistan because of the common interest between insurgents and drug traffickers to keep the south out of reach from the government in Kabul and the international aid community .
The north and center of Afghanistan have more order and government structure and should be offered incentives like development to persuade farmers and other players to cease opium production .
Oguz stated the necessity of a long - term effort to combat the drug problem with Afghanistan rebuilding from below - scratch .
Oguz stated the drug trade links into corruption and the insurgency and will not be an easy task to combat .
Oguz stated combating the drug trade in Thailand took 20 years even though Thailand had some functioning institutions .

Terrorism analyst and head of the Singapore - based International Centre for political violence and terrorism research Rohan Gunaratna stated the Consortium seeks to make the transfer of money difficult for extremist groups .
Gunaratna spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a closed - door Seminar on countering the financing of terrorism and stated militant groups including the Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah ( JI ) move between 2 and 3 million US dollars per month to fund terrorist activities in Southeast Asia .
Gunaratna stated the estimate was based on data gathered from the debriefing of captured militants , examination of documents seized from militant training camps and from intelligence reports .
Gunaratna stated groups involved in the fund transfers include the Abu Sayyaf and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front which both operate in the southern Philippines as well as the Southeast Asia - based JI and groups in southern Thailand and Indonesia .
Authorities blamed JI for bombings which killed mostly foreigners among 202 people on the Indonesian resort island of Bali in 2002 and a series of other attacks .
Gunaratna stated militant groups use the banking system , informal money transfers and couriers carrying bags filled with cash to transfer the funds .
Gunaratna stated a portion of the money is raised in Southeast Asia while some comes from the Middle East and other countries .

IAEA meets in Vienna to discuss Iran issue .
20080303 deputy head of the country 's atomic energy organization Mohammad Saeedi stated --
A new UN Security Council resolution against Iran 's nuclear activities would be irrational and unlawful and complicate the standoff with Western nations rather than promoting resolution of the issue .
The path of the Security Council and any new resolution lacks legal credibility .
Supporters should be held accountable for their illegal act .

Diplomats stated --
Depending on the outcome of the Security Council vote , the IAEA board is considering tabling a separate resolution demanding that Iran reveal its disputed nuclear activities .

The IAEA board has not made a resolution in 2 years .
US envoy to the IAEA Gregory Schulte stated to reporters prior to the meeting --
Despite limited progress in addressing past issues , troubling questions remain about Iranian activities that strongly suggest a clandestine weapons - related program .
The Board is likely to support the Security Council 's call for Iran to suspend its enrichment - related activities
Indications of weapons work constituting a violation of NPT obligations and Iran 's violation of Security Council resolutions provide strong reason for the Security Council and the IAEA to continue to investigate Iran .
ElBaradei 's latest report stated --
Iran addressed the majority of outstanding questions about its past nuclear program but refused to address allegations about its purported nuclear weapons work .
Iran is pursuing and expanding uranium enrichment in flagrant violation of UN demands .

Possibility of a global agreement to outlaw cluster bombs were given impetus as British prime minister Gordon Brown called for a total ban on the use of the weapons by the British military .
Hopes for a global agreement to outlaw cluster bombs were given a boost on 080522 when British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for a total ban on the use of the weapons by the British military .
The statement from Brown 's spokesman gave new impetus to ongoing negotiations at an international conference on cluster bombs in Dublin .
Brown 's spokesman said Brown had issued instructions to British negotiators in Dublin to work intensively to ban cluster bombs that cause unacceptable harm to civilians .
A British government spokesman said Brown had also asked the Ministry of Defence to assess the remaining munitions in use to ensure that there was no risk to civilians .
The new stance by the British government received a warm welcome from human rights activists and charities .
Head of arms control for Oxfam Anna MacDonald said Britain has at last come in from the cold .
Oxfam hopes that this strong statement from Brown will ensure that the UK signs onto the treaty and immediately gets rid of these weapons which maim and kill long after they have been dropped .
Co - Chair of the cluster munition coalition and Director of Landmine Action Simon Conway expressed gladness that Brown is following up on his previous public commitment to ban cluster bombs .
The Dublin Conference runs until May 30 and is aiming to strike a wide - ranging international agreement that would completely eradicate the use , production , transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions among signatories .
The United States Government on 080521 expressed opposition to a worldwide ban on cluster bombs and called instead for technological fixes that would make them safer .
Cluster bombs were first used in World War II and open in the air and scatter smaller bombs over a wide area .
The fact that many fail to detonate on impact have made them a risk to the lives of civilians for years .
The British military currently possesses 2 Types of cluster ammunition which are the artillery - fired m85 and the m73 launched from helicopters .
Campaigners claim British troops used the m85 bombs in the Iraq war in 030000 .

Amnesty International reports on light weapons impact and urges global arms treaty preventing weapons sales to human rights violators .
20080917 in the report ' blood at the crossroads ' Amnesty International stated that a new UN global arms treaty under negotiation should require Governments to actively prevent sales of weapons likely to be used in humans rights violations .
The report stated that the system of national laws regulating arms sales is ineffective and enables Unrestrained Weapons trading leading to violations of human rights .
153 countries voted for a UN motion to introduce a global arms treaty in 20061200 and UN member states will discuss progress on the Treaty in 20081000 .
Amnesty International stated that the US -- which rejected the arms treaty motion -- China , Egypt , India , Pakistan and Russia are stalling the treaty .
Amnesty arms control manager Brian Wood stated that a minority of skeptics preferring to ignore irresponsible arms transfers defy the majority of the international community 's approval of arms control and render most national arms controls and UN arms embargoes weak and ineffective .
The report catalogues the impact of light weapons in 9 countries .
The report states that small weapons were used with catastrophic effects by the Myanmar military to disperse protestors in 20070900 and Somalian armed factions in Mogadishu .
The report also profiles Darfur , Colombia , Guatemala , Guinea and especially Iraq .
The report stated --
The US Department of Defense has funded the majority of over 1 million rifles , pistols and infantry weapons for 530000 Iraqi security personnel since 2003 .
The funding process was mismanaged and unaccountable because the contracting out of the weapons deals rendered accurate documentation of supplies and recipients by people authorizing weapons and munitions transfers virtually impossible .
The mismanagement has augmented sectarian violence in Iraq since the 2003 US - led invasion .
Researcher Helen Hughes stated that Governments must meet their obligation through an arms trade treaty with a stipulation on human rights rather than ignoring the consequences of irresponsible international arms transfers .

The leaders of Australia and Japan launched a Commission on September 26 , 2008 to press for nuclear Non Proliferation and Disarmament ahead of review of a key international atomic treaty .
The International Commission on nuclear non - proliferation and disarmament was unveiled by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and new Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly .
The Panel is led by former Australian and Japanese foreign ministers Gareth Evans and Yoriko Kawaguchi respectively and has 15 - members .
It is comprised of former heads of State , ministers , military strategists and disarmament experts .
Rudd said it will seek to shape a global consensus in the lead up to the 2010 nuclear Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) Review Conference and beyond .
Rudd said the NPT is facing increased pressure from the actions of countries such as North Korea and Iran even though NPT is the most significant and successful arms control instrument of the nuclear age and the cornerstone of global disarmament efforts .
Iran has been accused of carrying out an illegal nuclear program while North Korea has defiantly moved to restart its illicit nuclear activities after stopping them .
Aso said Japan has always undertaken a realistic and concrete approach towards realizing a nuclear weapons free world because it is the only country that experienced the bombing of a nuclear weapon .
Aso assumed the premiership this week .
Aso told the Commission to hold active discussions and prepare meaningful recommendations for a more effective non - proliferation and disarmament regime .
A statement said the implications of a likely nuclear renaissance due to climate change and energy security concerns will be a focus of the Commission .
This includes the need for renewed attention to nuclear safeguards , safety and security .
The first meeting of the Commission will be held in Sydney from October 19 to 21 .
It will be hosted by the Australian Government .
Among those in the Commission are former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland , former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo , former US Defense Secretary William Perry , ex - Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas , China 's ex - UN envoy Wang Yingfan .

Archbishop Desmond Tutu makes appeal at UN for member states to support a global arms trade treaty to stop the casualties worldwide which result from the uncontrolled small arms trade .
South Africa 's retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu on 081021 appealed to UN member states to end the casualties which result from the uncontrolled small arms trade by backing a global arms trade treaty .
Tutu 's appeal came as the UN Disarmament Committee is set to vote on an arms trade treaty ( Att ) resolution next week .
Some 85 countries are co - sponsoring the text .
Tutu pointed out in a message delivered to all 192 missions at the United Nations in New York that in the last 2 years almost 0.75 million people have died as a result of armed violence .
Tutu said each Member State can and must act to control the deadly trade in weapons that is behind these deaths .
Tutu said there can be no further delay and that is time to end the slaughter .
Tutu said there are some States which are opposed to such a treaty and will seek to undermine and delay any further progress or will seek to convince others that this Treaty is not required or cannot work .
Tutu said these States must not be allowed to succeed because the human cost is too high .
Tutu 's message was delivered by activists of the control arms campaign .
The control arms campaign is pushing for a strong treaty to stop the sales of small arms around the world and was launched 5 years ago by Amnesty International , Oxfam International and the International Action Network on Small Arms .
The UN General Assembly in 061200 overwhelmingly adopted a resolution launching a process for a treaty to prevent arms transfers that fuel conflicts and serious human rights violations around the world .
Only the United States voted against .
24 Governments abstained .
That resolution asked then - UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to seek the views of Member States on the feasibility , scope and draft parameters for a comprehensive and legally binding instrument establishing common international standards for the import , export and transfer of conventional arms .

On 4 November 2008 in an address to the Danish parliamentary Defense Commission Danish Foreign Intelligence Service ( FE ) stated --
claims made in 2003 that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction were incorrect .
Fe 's work was careless .
Fe 's information was not based on credible sources .
Fe 's information sources were poor and insufficient .
Fe concluded wrongly that Iraq most likely had weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) .
The intelligence services of all other nations concluded wrongly that Iraq most likely had WMD .
It was difficult for western intelligence agencies to operate under Saddam 's regime .
few Iraqis were able to be recruited as informants under Saddam 's regime .
Iraqis recruited as spies turned out to be weak sources .
Last week Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen defended Danish involvement in the Iraq war .
Rasmussen stated --
Politicians widely believed that Saddam Hussein kept WMD and other chemical and biological weapons .
WMD were not the official reason for Denmark entering the war in Iraq .
Denmark entered the war in Iraq because Saddam refused to cooperate with United Nations .
A majority of lawmakers in the Danish Parliament approved military action .
Defense spokesman for the opposition Social Democrat Party John dyrby paulsen told Danish television that --
Rasmussen claimed Saddam Hussein did not cooperate with the UN only because he knew that the WMD argument would not be believed .

President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica called for a global reduction of military spending as a matter of international security on November 19 , 2008 .
Costa Rica is an unarmed state .
Arias in an address before the UN Security Council said the logic that leads a poor nation to spend excessive sums on its armies and not on its people is perverse and is the antithesis of human security .
It is a serious threat to international security .
Costa Rica presides over the UN Security Council this month .
Arias said Costa Rica is not a naive nation even though it has no military .
Arias is a 1987 novel Peace Prize laureate .
Arias said Costa Rica has not come for the abolition of all armies .
Costa Rica has not come to discuss reduction of world military spending which has reached 3.3 billion dollars a day .
Costa Rica proposed instead that a gradual reduction is not only possible but also imperative particularly for developing nations .
The Costa Rican President decried the limited application of article 26 of the UN Charter .
It calls on the Security Council to use international arms control to avoid diverting human and economic resources .
Arias said article 26 has been a dead letter in the vast cemetery of intentions for world peace until now .
Arias is promoting stronger multi - lateralism .
Arias said nations will continue to arm themselves at the expense of the people 's development and international security as long as the nations do not feel protected by strong regional organizations with real powers to act .
This is particularly true in the poorest countries .
Arias urged the Security Council to apply the Costa Rica consensus .
The consensus forgives debts and provides aid for developing countries that spend more on human resources than the military .
Arias pressed the international body to support the arms trade treaty .
The Treaty would control International arms sales to prevent the illicit use of weapons .
Arias said the 640 million small arms and light weapons that exist in the world has proven to be more lethal than nuclear weapons and is one of the primary threats to national and international security .
74 percent of the small arms and light weapons are owned by civilians .

Ret . Lt. - Gen. Anatoly Sokolov announced -- Soviet - built a - 135 missile defense system around Moscow is obsolete and inefficient .
He says Russia is not strong enough to modernize the existing antimissile system and should build new missile defense technologies instead .
15 April 2002 retired Russian Space Forces General Ret . Lt. - Gen. Anatoly Sokolov announced --
Soviet - built a - 135 missile defense system around Moscow is obsolete and inefficient .
The A - 135 system is the only such system in the world .
The A - 135 system should be removed .
The A - 135 system is unable to provide protection of the area or the country .
USSR deployed a - 35 anti - ballistic missile system in 1974 .
The A - 35 --
was deployed around Moscow .
consisted of radars and 64 missile interceptors .
was continually modified with independently - targeted multiple warheads .
A - 135 launched in 1994 as latest version of A - 35 .
A - 135 includes long - and medium - range missile interceptors .
The Anti - Ballistic Missile ( ABM ) Treaty allows the US and Russia to protect a single site with no more than 100 interceptors .
Russia 's missile defense system complied with the ABM Treaty .
In 1970s the US had a similar system to protect missile fields in North Dakota .
The US has destroyed this system .
The ABM Treaty bars a nationwide missile shield of the kind the US wants to deploy .
In December 2001 President George W. Bush warned Russia that the US would withdraw from the ABM Treaty in 6 months .
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated --
US withdrawal from the ABM Treaty was not a threat to Russian security .
US withdrawal from the ABM would hurt global stability .
Russian officials have said recently that the Moscow missile defense system could be upgraded in the next few years ,
Sokolov stated --
Russian government should not modernize the old missile defense system but build new missile defense technologies instead .
Modernization would be costly .
Russia is not strong enough to modernize the existing antimissile system .
Russia has lost several Soviet - built long - range radars essential for effective operation of an anti - missile system .
A new anti - missile system in Belarus would be inadequate .
Sokolov previously served as a top commander with Russia 's space forces .

Ukraine almost has all of the necessary approvals to join the European Space Agency 's program .
Ukraine is considered likely to gain the remaining approvals which will allow Ukraine to join the program and share its renowned space technologies .
The European Space Agency recommended on June 6 , 2002 that Ukraine join a multinational program that could greatly expand markets for Ukrainian space technology .
Head of the European Space Agency 's technology transfer program Pierre Brisson stated that the European Space Agency will have to ask the European Commission before confirming Ukraine can join the program .
Pierre Brisson also stated that the European Commission will most likely issue approval by August 5 , 2002 and work on the project could start on December 5 , 2002 .
The Ukrainian Government must also approve the Ukraine 's participation in the program but Deputy Director of Ukraine 's national space agency Eduard Kuznetsov stated that no problems are expected because of President Leonid Kuchma 's pro - European goals .
The European Space Agency 's endorsement followed Ukraine 's formal announcement to bid to join NATO on May 29 , 2002 .
Pierre Brisson led a team of European experts on a visit to Kiev to discuss commercial applications of Ukrainian space technology with representatives of the National Space Agency of Ukraine , scientists and business leaders .
Pierre Brisson stated that Ukraine 's materials and processing sectors are the most immediately promising to other European clients and could have a large impact on the future .
Eduard Kuznetsov stated that the space sector will outperform Ukraine 's overall integration schedules because the branch already has a record of international cooperation .
Ukraine is an impoverished former Soviet republic that gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and has since a space power .
President Leonid Kuchma 's goal for Ukraine is greater integration into Europe .
A Ukrainian company built in the Soviet era called yuzmash has helped found the Sea Launch project with the United States , Russia and Norway to launch satellites from converted sea - based oil drilling platforms .
A Ukrainian cosmonaut named loenid Kadenyuk has flown a successful mission on the U.S. space shuttle .
The European Space Agency 's program has so far transferred more than 100 technologies .
15 new companies with a turnover of 150 million euros or 140 million dollars and thousands of new jobs were created as a result .
Russia already participates in the European Space Agency 's program .

Embraer opened a new factory in the Sao Paulo state of Brazil in order to better compete to win a contract with the Brazilian air force .
Embraer inaugurated a new factory to build corporate jets and expand into the military aviation sector on June 11 , 2002 .
Mauricio betelho stated that the factory will allow Embraer to enter business sectors it has not yet entered .
The factory is located in an area called gaviao Peixoto in the Sao Paulo state in Brazil .
Gaviao Peixoto is a small orange and sugar cane farming town of 4500 inhabitants about 300 kilometers or 180 miles northwest of Sao Paulo .
This location was called ideal to test military aircraft at supersonic speeds .
Embraer is investing 150 million dollars over 10 years to upgrade the factory 's technology so that the factory can produce Embraer 's new legacy corporate jet and a range of military aircraft .
The military aircraft include the EMB - 145 reconnaissance and alx super Tucano training planes .
The factory contains a 5 kilometer or 3 mile long test runway which is the longest in the southern hemisphere .
Embraer President Mauricio betelho stated that the factory is expected to employ 1000 people by 2003 and 3000 people over the next decade .
The factory is expected to attract investments by the jetmaker 's suppliers .
Kawaski heavy industries of Japan is the first supplier to invest in the factory .
This supplier will use the factory to make wings for Embraer 's new 08 seat erj 190/195 passenger jets .
Mauricio betelho stated kawaski heavy industries is likely to be just the first of several suppliers to invest in the plant .
Embraer is the world 's 4th largest aircraft manufacturer and Brazil 's top exporter .
Embraer is 1 of 4 competitors for a contract to supply the Brazilian air force with 12 new supersonic fighters .

Fathers of militants killed in Kashmir vow to continue support for independence
Mohammed Aziz 's son Imam was killed in Kashmir in January 2002 .
Militants fighting against Indian rule buried the son in the Himalayan forests .
Imam was Aziz 's eldest son .
Aziz stated that he would not hesitate to sacrifice his remaining four sons for Kashmiri independence .
Aziz is angry that President Pervez Musharraf will obstruct Pakistan 's the militant Islamic groups that send fighters into the Indian - ruled portion of Kashmir .
Aziz stated his pride of being a father of a martyr and that President Musharraf has sold the blood of hundreds of freedom fighters by stopping men from waging jihad in Kashmir .
Aziz was in Lahore near the Indian border south of Kashmir .
10000 people rallied on June 16 , 2002 in Lahore including Aziz .
Political and religious groups vowed to fight for Kashmir despite Musharraf 's promise to stop militants based in Pakistan from crossing into Indian - controlled territory to stage attacks .
Militant groups that oppose Musharraf 's crackdown and Musharraf 's support for the U.S. - led war in Afghanistan have been blamed for attacks targeting foreigners and symbols of Western influence in Pakistan .
This included a bombing outside the U.S. consulate in Karachi that killed 12 people in June 2002 .
Musharraf pledged to stop cross - border infiltration because of pressure from the United States .
The United States fears the Kashmir crisis could trigger a full - scale conflict between India and Pakistan .
The dispute over Kashmir began when India and Pakistan gained independence from Britain in 1947 .
The two countries both have nuclear weapons and have fought two wars over Kashmir .
There are increased tensions of war between India and Pakistan after an attack on an Indian army camp .
The attack killed 34 people and was one of the deadliest single assaults since 1989 .
In 1989 militants launched an insurgency in Indian - controlled Kashmir seeking independence or a merger with Islamic Pakistan .
Kashmir is India 's only Muslim - majority state .
India is dominated by Hinduism .
India accuses Islamabad of funding and training guerrillas .
The guerrillas cross the Line of Control that divides Kashmir and carry out attacks on the Indian side .
Tens of thousands of Indian troops , guerrillas and civilians have been killed .
Pakistan says it only provides moral and political support for Kashmir 's named freedom fighters .
Diplomatic intervention and Musharraf 's suppression of militants and cross - border attacks have decreased tensions of war .
There is strong resentment among Pakistan 's conservative Islamic groups .
Fighter with Hezb - ul Mujahedeen Anas Javed said that Pakistan soldiers deployed near the Kashmir border used to pray for success in Jihad but are now terrorists according to Musharra .
Hezb - ul Mujahedeen is one of the main militant groups fighting in Kashmir .
The leaders of two other outlawed Pakistani militant groups that operate in Kashmir Lashkar - e - Tayyaba and Jaish - e - Mohammed are in police custody and under house arrest respectively .
Musharraf 's crackdown has decreased tensions about war .
The dispute over Kashmir continues with no signs of abating .
A Board was created during the rally in Lahore bearing the names of militants killed during the 12 - year insurgency .
Safdar Sadiqui 's son was on it .
Sadiqui 's son was killed in Kashmir in 1993 at age 22 .
Islamic cleric Sadiqui stated that his son gave his life for Kashmir and that Sadiqui would do whatever possible to liberate Kashmir .
Sadiqui is associated with Pakistan 's main hard - line religious group Jamaat - e - Islami .
Muslim cleric Mohammed Yousaf stated his anger at the Pakistan army for preventing men from fighting against India in Kashmir at the Line of Control .
Yousaf sat beside Sadiqui .
Yousaf said that Pakistan is incomplete without Kashmir .

Cuban biotechnology pharmaceuticals program seeks to expand to overseas markets in developing countries .
The Cuban Government seeks to increase pharmaceutical profits by significantly expanding overseas markets through the development of novel pharmaceuticals and the sale of the world 's most lucrative biotechnology drug , erythropoetin ( EPO ) .
Amgen Inc. invented EPO and shares patent rights with Johnson & Johnson and Kirin Brewery in the most lucrative industrialized markets -- the US , Europe and Japan .
In 2001 EPO generated 6 billion dollars in sales for the 3 corporations .
Amgen sells EPO in the US as epogen for over 36 dollars per dose .
US epogen consumers pay over 10000 dollars each annually for the drug .
EPO is a genetically engineered protein used legally by kidney dialysis and chemotherapy patients and illegally by athletes to increase the concentration of oxygenated red blood cells .
An increasing quantity of biotechnology drugs are produced without any attempts to obtain licenses in developing nations .
US patent holders consider the trade in generic drugs a violation to their intellectual property .
Consumers in developing countries appreciate lower prices on generic drugs .
Cuba considers the generic drug trade good business and currently manufactures EPO for sale in Argentina , Brazil , India and other countries that do not acknowledge most US and European drug patents .
Cuban biotechnology executive Blanca tormo stated that Cuba carefully abides by intellectual property laws and exclusively sells EPO in countries in which no entity has exclusive patent rights .
The largest potential pharmaceutical market is in the 1.3 billion person Chinese market .
Amgen , Kirin , the small Canadian biotechnology company Dragon Pharmaceuticals Inc. and at lease 4 Chinese companies currently sell EPO in China .
The generic product costs as low as 5 dollars per dose in China .
By joining the World Trade Organization in 2001 China agreed to abide by WTO intellectual property agreements but the agreements contain mechanisms allowing developing nations to circumvent patents , particularly in pharmaceuticals , when public health concerns are deemed to override the patents .
Current state of biotechnology in Cuba --
The Cuban biotechnology industry currently generates 100 million dollars annually and reaches markets in over 40 countries .
Cuba 's genetic engineering and biotechnology center occupies modern towers approved by Fidel Castro and employs over 1000 people to engineer proteins to combat major terminal illnesses .
Cuba currently produces novel biotechnology products : hepatitis B and meningitis B vaccines , a skin growth factor , interferons , thrombosis and heart attack medicines and AIDS treatments .
Cuba has produced over 78 million doses of hepatitis B vaccine .
Cuba licensed its meningitis B vaccine to the British company GlaxoSmithKline , which hopes to eventually sell the vaccine in the United States under a Clinton - era exemption to the Cuban trade embargo .
Cuba is cooperating with the small Canadian company YM biosciences on trials of a head and neck cancer treatment .
Cuba is seeking further partnerships with foreign companies in vaccine research for AIDS , 8 types of cancer and cholera .
Cuban officials including attendees of the annual bio 2002 Industry Conference 20020600 in Toronto stated that negotiations for new biotechnology trade and production agreements were in progress with Brazil , Malaysia , Netherlands , Spain , Mexico , Venezuela , Vietnam , Ukraine , Germany and the United States .
Cuba has or is negotiating technology transfer agreements with 14 countries , chiefly developing nations including India , Algeria and South Africa .
20020500 US Undersecretary of State for Arms Control John Bolton stated that the US believes Cuba has at least a limited offensive biological warfare research and development effort and has provided dual - use biotechnology to other rogue states .
Scientists , Castro , and former US President Jimmy Carter , who visited Cuba directly after Bolton 's statement , dismissed Bolton 's statement as unfair .
Tormo stated that Bolton unintentionally increased publicity for the Cuban biotechnology program .

Russian military space forces put on test duty an optical space - object tracking facility located in the ex - Soviet republic of Tajikistan
The Russian military space forces on 020718 inaugurated an optical tracking facility that is intended to monitor objects in space and put it on test duty .
The okno optical tracking facility is near the town of Nurek in the central region of the ex - Soviet republic of Tajikistan and located 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) southeast of the Tajik capital Dushanbe .
Russian Space Forces said in a statement carried by the Interfax - military news agency that the okno ( window ) complex is capable of tracking objects 40000 kilometers ( 24800 miles ) from Earth .
The okno offers a better range and precision than standard radar facilities according to the Space Forces .
The report did not elaborate on how the okno works .
The report saids Space Forces chief Col . - Gen. Anatoly Perminov traveled to the site to report on the facility 's launch to Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov , .
According to images on the Federation of American Scientists ' web site , the facility involves telescope - like equipment housed in several large spheres .
The okno is located in Tajikistan 's mountains 2200 meters ( 7260 feet ) above sea level and takes advantage of the area 's fine weather and high transparency of the atmosphere .
Such conditions are not found elsewhere in the former Soviet Union .
The site describes it as similar to the U.S. GEODSS system , or ground - based electro - optical Deep Space Surveillance .
Three such U.S. facilities are operational .
The construction of the facility started in 790000 , but stopped after the 910000 Soviet collapse when Tajikistan slid into a 5 year civil war that undermined its economy and left its population in deep poverty .
About 25000 Russian troops and border guards are deployed in Tajikistan to help protect its volatile southern border with Afghanistan and prevent drug smuggling .

Italy is leading a technology transfer initiative developed by the G - 8 countries which will improve the technology of developing countries .
The goal of the initiative is to provide the infrastructure and good governance needed to alleviate poverty .
Italy sponsors technology transfer to developing countries as a form of foreign aid and alleviating poverty .
Premier Silvio Berlusconi supported and sponsored the initiative with counterparts at recent international gatherings including the last G - 8 Summit in Canada .
Italy persuaded partners to let Italy lead the G - 8 summit 's e-government initiative called DOT Force or digital opportunity task force .
Former IBM executive and current technology minister of Italy Lucio Stanca is leading Italy 's Internet program for developing countries as part of the Group of Eight 's efforts to reduce the digital divides .
Silvio Berlusconi gave Lucio Stanca his current role of modernizing Italy 's bureaucracy .
Lucio Stanca stated that Italy will not targeting countries that have very basic needs .
The first technology transfer projects will be implemented in the fall .
One such project is creating an electronic database for real estate in Mozambique .
So far 12 million euros or 12 million dollars have been allocated to finance the initial phase of these projects .
This cost is only a fraction of the total cost .
Italy is financing most of the cost but the World Bank and possibly some private telecommunications companies are also contributing .
Lucio Stanca stated that the world must solve the problem of world hunger , disease and education but in order to do that the world must first help create good governance .
The rationale behind creating good governance is that by making the public administration of developing countries more transparent and accountable developing countries would become more attractive potential recipients of traditional forms of aid such as loans and investments .
In effect good governance would invalidate the reason used by countries that do not do enough that donating is not appropriate because it is impossible to know whether the aid would reach its true destination .
The United Nations telecommunications agency stated that 83 countries in Africa , Asia , and the former Soviet Union still have less than 10 telephone lines for every 100 people .
Other studies note that even though the Internet has been in use for more than a decade , only about 10 percent of the world 's population has access to it .
Reducing the digital divide has taken on a central role in the fight against global poverty in recent years .
The United Nations has repeatedly stated that the world 's poor may be further marginalized if there is no improvement in access to information technology .
Reducing the digital divide was declared a priority at last year 's G - 8 Summit in Genoa which included Russia .
Italy launched pilot programs in 5 countries at a conference in Sicily sponsored by the United Nations and Italy in April , 2002 .
The Conference focused on how technologies can be used to improve administration in developing countries .
The plan for Albania is computerization of demographic surveys .
The plan for Jordan is e-procurement which will allow online trading , auctions , payment and settlement of bills .
The plan for Tunisia is the creation of electronic databases to facilitate tax collection .
The plan for Nigeria and Mozambique is the creation an electronic database for real estate .
Washington - based adviser at World Learning Ann hudock stated that poverty reduction will only occur when the poor themselves are brought into the policy process .
Oxfram America is a nonprofit development group based in Boston .
World Learning is an organization promoting education and justice .

Indian Deputy Prime Minister accuses Pakistan of becoming a haven for terrorists escaped from Afghanistan and permitting increasing guerrilla attacks in Kashmir .
20021228 Indian Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani stated at a gathering of paramilitary police officers in New Delhi --
Intelligence reports state that al-Qaeda members have fled from American forces in Afghanistan and relocated to western Pakistan and Pakistan - controlled Kashmir , making Pakistan the new epicenter of terrorism .
Cross - border incursions by Islamic guerrillas into Indian - controlled Kashmir increased in recent weeks .
The international community must beware of the situation , which could prove expensive for any country .
Pakistan 's foreign ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmad Khan stated in Islamabad --
The accusations were without merit .
Indian leaders have previously leveled baseless allegations at Pakistan .
India should resolve its issues with Pakistan including the core issue of Kashmir to ensure durable peace in the region , rather than accuse Pakistan .
India has refused talks with Pakistan .
Pakistani and American officials stated that over 400 Taliban and al-Qaeda suspects have been arrested in Pakistan .
20021228 the head of the Pakistan - based guerrilla group Hezb - ul Mujahadeen Syed Salahuddin stated at a meeting of Hezb commanders in mazzafarabad , the capital of Pakistani Kashmir , that Hezb will continue and increase jihad in the Indian state of Jammu - Kashmir with full force .
Hezb is the largest of over 12 militias battling Indian troops for Kashmir 's independence from mostly Hindu India , or its merger with Islamic Pakistan .
Advani stated --
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf 's assurance to the United States of ending cross - border terrorism in Kashmir , terminating militant camps and banning dozens of Islamic groups was merely cosmetic .
Many of the banned terrorist groups continued activity in Pakistan and Kashmir under new names .
The Indian army stated that 4 Islamic militants were killed in 2 separate gun battles 20021228 .
Indian army spokesman Lt. Col . Mukhtar Singh stated that soldiers stormed a militant hideout in Kreeri , a village 35 kilometers north of Srinagar , Jammu - Kashmir 's summer capital .
2 militants identified as members of the Pakistan - based Lashkar - e - Tayyaba group were killed .
Approximately 25 kilometers southwest of Sringar 2 militants were killed in a second gun battle .
Local police reported 4 civilians wounded in the crossfire .
India and Pakistan have fought 2 of 3 wars over control of Kashmir .
Both countries claim the entirety of the region .
The Islamic insurgency in Kashmir has lasted 13 years and killed over 61000 people .
India accuses Pakistan of funding and training the cross - border guerrillas .
Pakistan claims it offers moral rather than material support to the rebels , whom it considers freedom fighters .

A virus - like computer infection spread through Asian digital networks and disrupted Internet services in several countries .
The virus is thought to have utilized a security flaw in microsoft software .
A virus - like computer infection spread through worldwide digital networks and interrupted Internet service in parts of Asia on 25 January 2003 .
The infection slowed or halted web browsing and e-mail services in several countries .
Users and news media reported outages or slowdowns in Thailand , Japan , Malaysia , the Philippines , South Korea and India .
Internet service providers said a sudden surge in traffic jammed networks on the afternoon of 25 January 2003 .
Antivirus vendor Symantec Corp. estimated at least 22000 systems were affected worldwide .
A technical support representative for Internet Thailand stated --
A virus or worm attacked a bug in microsoft software .
While traffic among domestic Thai servers was normal , exchanges with international servers began slowing down around 12:00 pm ( 0500 GMT ) .
The exchanges came to a halt within hours before recovering the evening of 25 January 2003 .
U.S. officials stated the attack sought out vulnerable computers on the Internet using a known flaw in software from Microsoft Corp. called SQL server 2000 .
The attacking software code scanned for victim computers randomly and aggressively and sent out thousands of probes each second which overwhelmed many Internet data pipelines .
Local Thai subscribers stated that other Thai Internet service providers appeared to be unaffected .
NHK television in Japan reported --
Some of the Japan 's Internet connections experienced heavy traffic .
A public university computer had been hit by over 200000 transmissions in 1 hour .
Security firms were investigating the incident .
Traffic - directing computers at Korea Telecom freetel and SK Telecom failed to function in South Korea and affected millions of Internet users .
Chief system engineer at KT freetel Kim Chang - Rae stated excessive traffic caused 1 of KT freetel 's main domain servers to fail which forced other servers to shut down in a chain reaction .
Officials stated the system was restored after several hours but service remained slow .
The failure affected weekend Internet banking and shopping traffic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday .
Chunghwa Telecom Co. Ltd. is 1 of the largest Internet providers in Taiwan .
A customer service operator from Chunghwa Telecom Co. Ltd. stated service experienced difficulties and that some customers were n't able to access the web .

Philippine intelligence reports reveal Singapore - based al-Qaida group 's plans to bomb embassies , U.S. corporations , and warships in Singapore and to crash hijacked planes at Singapore 's National Airport .
The plans were successfully stopped in their final stages in December 2001 and 15 cell members were arrested .
Philippine intelligence reports obtained by the Associated Press reveal a Singapore - based al-Qaida group 's plans to attack embassies of the United States , Great Britain , Israel and Australia , to attack U.S. corporations and warships in Singapore and to crash a hijacked plane at the country 's international airport .
The group ordered a chemist to buy 4 tons of ammonium nitrate .
The amount is 4 times the amount of explosive that Timothy McVeigh used to bomb the Oklahoma City Federal Building .
The embassy attacks were successfully stopped in the final stages by U.S. investigators and allies in Southeast Asia but the explosives were not recovered .
1 of the phillipine reports states that Singapore is a target for terrorist attacks because of its 17000 U.S. residents and 6000 multinational companies including several American companies .
The terrorists belonged to Jemaah Islamiah designated by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization and described in 1 of the phillipine reports as part of the broader al-Qaida syndicate .
The group planned attacks in Singapore before and after the hijackings in the United States on 11 September 2001 .
The group is believed responsible for attacks throughout Southeast Asia .
The group is suspected in the bombings in Bali that killed approximately 200 people in October 2002 .
The attacks in Singapore were prevented after 15 individuals were arrested in December 2001 .
2 of the individuals arrested were released .
1 of the Philippine reports stated that local officials and Western business executives were shocked by the ability of Al-Qaida to plant operatives in such a tightly controlled society as Singapore .
The members of the 4 or 5 - man terror cells led normal lives and avoided contact with known Islamic organizations .
The members were not known to be active members of mosques in Singapore .
In efforts to avoid detection the members used code names and code numbers , communicated by e-mail , encrypted their computer diskettes and used prepaid mobile phone cards .
Investigators stated that after the U.S. military campaign began in Afghanistan members of Jemaah Islamiah planned to procure 21 tons of explosive materials and bought 4 tons of ammonium nitrate in an operation to attack embassies in Singapore .
The ammonium nitrate was purchased by captured Malaysian chemist and retired army captain Yazid Sufaat .
Authorities state that Sufaat hosted 11 September hijackers and the accused terrorism suspect Zacarias Moussaoui in Malaysia at different times in 2000 .
Authorities state that Sufaat provided Moussaoui with counterfeit documents with which to enter the United States .
Moussaoui was arrested in August 2001 in Minnesota and remains the only U.S. defendant indicted as a conspirator with the perpetrators of the 11 September attacks .
The Singaporean cell members were believed to be conducting reconnaissance when they were apprehended .
The explosive materials were sent to an Indonesian island off Singapore .
During the attack planning an Indonesian and a Kuwaiti arrived in Singapore with instructions for the embassy operations .
Cell members guided them to the U.S. embassy which was videotaped including close - up shots .
The adjoining Australian embassy was also videotaped .
In a separate plot a member of the cell took digital photographs of U.S. military aircraft and personnel using Singapore 's Paya Lebar air base .
Singapore authorities believe a cell leader traveled to Afghanistan and briefed al-Qaida leaders about the proposed shuttle bus attack between August 1999 and April 2000 .
The al-Qaida officials apparently turned down the plan because the target was not large enough .
A few days after the Singapore arrests in December 2001 a videotape was found in an abandoned house in Kabul , Afghanistan in which a narrator describes locations in Singapore where bombs could be hidden to attack Americans .
Investigators searched the homes of those detained in Singapore and found an identical videotape .
The Singapore wing of Jemaah Islamiah may also have Thai connections since at least 5 members who eluded the 2001 arrests fled to Thailand .
1 of the reports stated --
The group had previously plotted to conduct 7 simultaneous explosions in different areas of Singapore .
The Group had further planned to hijack a U.S. , British or Singaporean plane and crash it into Changi Airport in order to threaten the U.S. government to halt its military strikes against Afghanistan .
In February 2003 Indonesian police announced the arrest of the alleged head of the cell in Singapore Mas Selamat Kastari who was suspected of planning the airport attack .
Kastari also was suspected in the proposed shuttle bus attack .
The reports arose after intelligence agents from Southeast Asian countries realized after the 11 September 2001 attacks that many radical Islamic groups in the region had close connections to each other and to Osama bin Laden 's terrorist network .

The Brazilian Government is seeking to buy military technology from France that could help Brazil build a nuclear submarine .
It also wants to establish a strategic partnership with France involving exchange of experiences and knowledge and hopes to discuss deals involving France 's Rafale fighter jet and the Cougar cargo helicopter .
Brazil 's Defense Ministry said 080128 that the Brazilian Government is seeking to buy military technology from France that could help Brazil become the first country in Latin America to have a nuclear submarine .
Defense ministry spokesman Jose Ramos said Defense Minister Nelson Jobim traveled to France during 080120-080126 with the main objective of the visit being to discuss the possible purchase of a diesel - powered Scorpene class submarine that would serve as a model for the development of a nuclear submarine .
Ramos said that any defense - related agreement that may eventually be signed with the Government of France must include the transfer of technology and noted that Brazil has nuclear reactors and fuel enrichment capacity but has not had the technology to build a nuclear submarine .
Ramos declined to confirm a report published 080128 by the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper saying that the Brazilian Government would buy the submarine for US $ 600 million and pay off the amount over 20 years at an annual interest rate of 2.4 percent .
The Brazilian Government has discussed building a nuclear submarine for decades and began a formal program in 1979 .
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced US $ 540 million in new funding for the program and for existing uranium enrichment efforts in 070700 .

International Atomic Energy Agency director ElBaradei says the biggest danger facing the world is not new nuclear States but the risk of extremist groups obtaining atomic weapons .
Director General of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed ElBaradei told a conference of the world 's top defense officials on 080209 that the biggest danger facing the world is not new nuclear States but the risk of extremist groups obtaining atomic weapons .
ElBaradei urged a reduction of the world 's nuclear stockpile and better controls and said that an extremist group would use nuclear weapons upon procuring such weapons .
ElBaradei said that even countries which have nuclear weapons know that a country which uses nuclear weapons will be pulverized but that extremist groups will use nuclear weapons if possible .
ElBaradei said that countries need to be aware that extremist groups procuring nuclear weapons is the number one security threat the world is facing and added as a note of caution that given the state of the system of international controls it was hard to determine whether nuclear materials were ending up with extremist groups .
ElBaradei said much of the material that is reported stolen is never recovered and that a lot of the material recovered has never been reported stolen .
ElBaradei said in reference to Iran that the international community should quickly engage in talks with the Iranian government to secure guarantees that the Iranian nuclear program will not be used to develop weapons and that such confidence can only be built through direct negotiations .
U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman said that Iran remained the world 's top arms control challenge and that it would be a profound mistake to focus on the recent U.S. national intelligence estimate that suggested Iran no longer had a nuclear weapons program .
Lieberman pointed out that in the Nie report which said that the Iranian government 's covert work on bomb design may have been temporarily suspended in 03000 it was also and far more importantly stated that Iran 's overt work on enrichment continues apace .
German foreign minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier similarly emphasized that the Nie report in no way grants Iran any kind of absolution .
Germany has been working with the 5 permanent U.N. Security Council members on the Iranian nuclear issue .
Steinmeier consequently believes it is right for the international community to keep up the pressure on Iran .
Steinmeier said that in the interests of global safety the international community 's common goals must continue to be to prevent Iranian nuclear armament and to counteract the erosion of the Nonproliferation Treaty .

Indian police stated that the man headed an illegal organ transplant ring based in the upscale New Delhi suburb of gurgao .
The syndicate may have sold up to 500 kidneys to clients who traveled to India from around the world in the past 9 years .
Nancy schepeter - Hughes stated that no accurate estimate of how many people are trafficked for organs exists but a conservative estimate would be 15000 trafficked kidneys per year .
Nancy schepeter - Hughes stated that there strong cases documenting coercion in Eastern Europe , Turkey , Israel , India and the United States .
Nancy schepeter - Hughes stated that most victims of kidney trafficking are coerced by need and not by physical force .

Yosuke shimazono wrote the paper .
The paper also noted that the international organ trade is not well understood because of a lack of data and lack of effort to integrate the available information .
The Vienna Forum ends on February 15 , 2008 and is being convened by the United Nations global initiative to fight human trafficking .

Santos backed off slightly and told the Associated Press on 080305 that Colombian authorities have no evidence or indication that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia are seeking to use the uranium to build a radioactive dirty bomb .
Santos said in a telephone interview from Brussels that what Santos had meant was to take note and not take it lightly and said that putting the FARC rebels and the word uranium in the same sentence was alarming .
The FBI has an office in Bogota and Spokesman Richard kolko said in Washington that the FBI has no information or intelligence regarding the FARC attempting to use weapons of mass destruction .
The FARC has been fighting successive Colombian Governments for more than 4 decades using conventional weapons .
The document addressing uranium was found in a laptop belonging to a top FARC commander named Raul Reyes .
Reyes was killed on 080301 in a raid into Ecuador that has generated intense international criticism .
The poorly written communication addressed to Reyes was dated 080216 and was signed by Edgar Tovar .
Santos said Tovar commands a FARC front near Ecuador .
Tovar wrote that a man named Belisario in Bogota supplies Tovar with explosives and sent Tovar a catalog and specifications .
Tovar wrote that Belisario proposed to sell each kilo at US $ 2.5 million and deliver it and that Tovar and Reyes would then find a buyer .
Tovar wrote the deal would be with a Government and to sell them a sizable amount .
Tovar wrote Belisario had 50 kilos ready and could sell a lot more as Belisario had direct contact with uranium suppliers .
The uranium reference in Tovar 's writing was quickly cited by Colombia 's government while seeking to deflect criticism over the raid .
Gen. Oscar Naranjo said at an explosive news conference that the FARC mentioning negotiations for 50 kilos of uranium means that the FARC are taking big steps in the world of terrorism to become a global aggressor and were not just domestic guerrillas but transnational terrorists .
Santos took Colombia 's complaints to the European Union 's foreign affairs representative Javier Solano on 080305 .
Santos told the AP after meeting with Solano that the Europeans were really worried about the uranium and were not taking the issue lightly .
Colombian officials say they have no other information from the laptop or other sources indicating FARC interest in radioactive materials or unconventional weapons .
It was n't clear what exactly the material Tovar was writing about might be .
Santos said the uranium mentioned in the communication sounded like processed uranium .
The price mentioned suggests that the uranium would be processed and hence dangerous .
Charles Ferguson is a physicist with the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington and said that unprocessed uranium is relatively harmless and goes for about US $ 100 a kilo .
Ferguson expressed fear if the uranium in question were the highly enriched weapons - grade uranium capable of being used in a low - yield improvised nuclear device .
Ferguson was not aware of any highly enriched uranium of appreciable quantities in the region near Colombia and Venezuela .

A parliamentary commission report said on April 9 , 2008 that money from drug trafficking in Bulgaria has been used to fund terrorist groups .
A parliamentary commission report stated on April 9 , 2008 that money from drug trafficking in Bulgaria has been used to fund terrorist groups .
The report said Bulgarian crime groups engaged in trafficking and drugs sometimes work together with Arab citizens linked to terrorist organizations .
The Associated Press obtained a copy of the document .
The report said that part of the profit from trafficking in drugs such as amphetamines has been used to finance terrorist organizations like Hezbollah , Islamic Jihad , and Christian militias in Lebanon .
The U.S. State Department said in its 2008 international narcotics control strategy report that Bulgaria continues to be a source of drug production .
Part of that is being smuggled into Turkey and the Middle East .
The parliamentary report was issued amid revelations of illegal links between senior police officers and criminals .
The document said the amount of illegal drugs seized by authorities declined after classified police information had been leaked to criminals .
The leaks prompted the arrest of senior police and a motion of no - confidence from opposition parties .
The document is based on figures from the National Security Agency .
The motion will be voted on April 11 , 2008 .
Bulgaria 's government has been repeatedly criticized by the European Union over its inability to tackle rampant corruption and organized crime .
Bulgaria 's government is a Socialist - led coalition .
Bulgaria is a Balkan country of 7.7 million people and lies on a major drug trafficking route linking Western Europe , the Middle East and southwestern Asia .

25 members of the Muslim Brotherhood were convicted and sentenced to jail time while 15 members were acquitted .
The charges against members of the Muslim Brotherhood included money laundering and terrorism .
A security official stated that on 15 April 2008 an Egyptian military court known for severe verdicts convicted 25 key members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood with sentences up to 10 years in jail .
The security official attended the trial at the court north of Cairo but spoke on condition of anonymity because the official is not authorized to speak to the media .
The official stated the charges against members of Egypt 's largest opposition group included money laundering and terrorism but it was not immediately clear if the 25 were found guilty of both offenses .
The official stated that 15 other defendants were acquitted .
Among the acquitted were businessman Abdel - Rahman Saudi who runs a supermarket chain in Egypt and a journalist .
Authorities created a security ring around the courthouse with 100s of policemen creating checkpoints on the road leading to the court before the verdict announcement .
Police searched vehicles and drove away reporters and family members of the defendants .
A security official stated that approximately 20 people including relatives and reporters were detained .
Defense lawyer Abdel - Moneim Abdel - Maksoud stated the judge entered the courtroom and issued the ruling but then left without notifying the opposition group 's defense lawyers who stood outside the courthouse after being prevented by policemen from entering the courtroom .
The 25 sentenced included the Brotherhood 's chief strategist Khayrat El-Shater and the Brotherhood 's prominent financier and businessman Hassan Malek .
El-Shater joined the Brotherhood in 1974 and has been jailed 4 times for a total of 7 years on charges relating to membership in the Brotherhood which was outlawed before 1958 .
Malek owns a chain of furniture stores and textile factories and is known as 1 of the Brotherhood 's main financiers .
El-Shater and Malek each received 7 - year sentences .
El-Shater and Malek 's property was confiscated and is believed to be worth millions of dollars .
Abdel - Maksoud stated the confiscation will affect the Brotherhood 's financial bases .
Abdel - Maksoud stated that a recent amendment to the Egyptian judicial system allows defendants to appeal within 60 days .
The 25 people sentenced have been in custody since December 2006 .
The arrests were believed to have been sparked by a militia - style demonstration by student Brotherhood members from the Al-Azhar University in Cairo .
The demonstrators wore black and masks similar to those of the militant Palestinian Hamas and Lebanon 's Hezbollah groups .
The demonstration prompted a government investigation into whether the Brotherhood had resurrected a military wing .
The Brotherhood figures were referred to a military court after the arrests .
The referral is authorized under emergency laws in effect since 1981 that allow the president to refer civilians to military tribunals .
Brotherhood members have since been routinely tried before military courts but the trial in 2007-2008 is the largest in years .
The verdict in the yearlong trial occurred amid a government crackdown on the Brotherhood and unrest in Egypt over rising food prices and stagnant wages .
More than 800 Brotherhood members have been detained in 2008 in an effort to decrease influence as President Hosni Mubarak enters the 27th year in power .
100s of Brotherhood members and supporters have been detained in Security sweeps since October 2006 .
The 40 senior figures on trial were detained as part of the sweeps .
7 senior figures were tried in absentia and are believed to be outside the country .
Some of the 7 's whereabouts are unknown .
5 of the absent senior figures received 10 - year prison terms including Swiss - based Egyptian - born businessman Youssef M. Nada whose company has been listed by the United States since 2001 as an organization accused of helping fund terrorism .
London - based human rights group Amnesty International called the sentences on 15 April 2008 a perversion of justice and demanded the men be released and retried in a civilian court .
Amnesty International said in a statement that the sentences leave little doubt that the Egyptian authorities are determined to undermine what has become the main opposition group in Egypt .
Amnesty International stated trying civilians before military courts flouts international standards of fair trial and is inherently unjust .
The Muslim Brotherhood 's supreme leader Mohammed Mahdi Akef denounced the verdict and stated that Egyptian authorities are corrupt gangsters .
Akef stated to the Associated Press that there was no evidence against the convicted and that acquittals for the convicted are expected .
Akef stated in a telephone interview that gangs not politicians rule Egypt .
Akef would not discuss the Brotherhood 's future plans .
The Brotherhood won 88 of parliament 's 454 seats in the 2005 elections with Brotherhood candidates running as independents .

South African government officials will not intervene to disallow Chinese arms shipment to Zimbabwe despite volatile political situation following contested presidential election .
South African officials approved transit of the arms shipment to Zimbabwe stating it cannot act unilaterally to prevent a trade deal between 2 countries .
On 17 April 2008 a South African government spokesman stated that South Africa will not intervene to stop a shipment of Chinese - made weapons from reaching Zimbabwe despite the acute instability of the political situation in Zimbabwe .
South African government spokesman Themba Maseko stated that the Zimbabwean government 's failure to release election results 2 weeks after elections is cause for great concern and that the dire situation requires mediation .
Maseko 's comments were the strongest issued on the subject by the South African Government to date .
South African President Thabo Mbeki is the main mediator in Zimbabwe .
Mbeki has stated that there is no crisis in Zimbabwe despite the increasing violence and intimidation since the 29 March 2008 vote and the refusal of Zimbabwe 's election commission to release results that independent observers and the opposition State show President Robert Mugabe lost the vote .
Critics call the South African reaction appeasement .
Criticism increased on 17 April 2008 following a report that South African mediator Sydney Mufamadi led an arms control committee meeting that approved transit of a shipment of Chinese weapons across South African territory en route to Zimbabwe .
The Chinese ship called an Yue Jiang docked in Durban harbor in South Africa after receiving approval from Port authorities late on 16 April 2008 .
The Beeld newspaper stated the ship was carrying approximately 3 million rounds of ammunition for small arms and AK - 47s , approximately 3500 mortars and mortar launchers and 1500 rockets for rocket - propelled grenades .
The newspaper stated it obtained a copy of the ship 's cargo documentation finalized 3 days after Zimbabwe 's election on 01 April 2008 .
A South African government official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed the presence of weapons on the ship but gave no further details .
Durban port authorities and police explosives inspectors could not immediately be reached for comment .
Government spokesman Maseko stated that if administrative papers are in order the Government of South Africa cannot intervene to prevent weapons from being transported through its territory to a neighboring landlocked country .
After a cabinet meeting Maseko stated to reporters --
The Government of South Africa cannot act unilaterally to prevent a trade deal between 2 countries .
South Africa is not involved in the arrangement .
It would be possible but very difficult for South Africa to intervene and to disallow the shipment .
There was presently no trade embargo against Zimbabwe .
China is one of Zimbabwe 's main trade partners and allies .
A group representing mainly white South Africans called afriforum stated it would organize protests along the route to Zimbabwe .
Afriforum 's kallie kriel stated that the National Conventional Arms Control Committee had granted approval for the transit of the weapons on 14 April 2008 .
Kriel stated he had written to Committee Chairman and Local Government Minister Sydney Mufamadi asking him to retract the permission .
Kriel stated that the South African Government 's approval for the transport of the arms across South African territory effectively means that the government is replacing its ineffective policy of silent diplomacy with a more catastrophic policy of complicity with the State violence and human rights violations committed by the Zimbabwean government against its own citizens .
The South African opposition Democratic Alliance agreed with kriel 's comments .
Mufamadi also heads the South African mediating team between Zimbabwe 's ruling ZANU - PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change .
Mufamadi 's office referred reporters to the Arms Control Committee whose spokesman did not immediately return phone calls .

The South African Government stated on April 4 , 2008 that the South African Government will probably not stop the arms shipment head to Zimbabwe .
This decision is controversial because Zimbabwe is currently politically unstable .
A South African government spokesman stated on April 4 , 2008 that South Africa will not intervene to stop a shipment of Chinese - made weapons from reaching Zimbabwe even though the political situation in Zimbabwe is dire .
The shipment is in a ship called the an Yue hiang which was anchored outside Durban harbor after receiving permission late on April 16 , 2008 to dock .
The shipment contains nearly 3 million rounds of ammunition for small arms and AK - 47s , about 3500 mortars and mortar launchers and 1500 rockets for rocket - propelled grenades .
This report comes from the Beeld newspaper which claimed to have a copy of the ship 's cargo documentation finalized on April 1 , 2008 which was 3 days after Zimbabwe 's election .
An anonymous government official confirmed that the shipment contained weapons but gave no further details .
Durban port authorities and police explosives inspectors could not be reached for comment .
The South African Revenue Service said customs officials were bound by confidentiality rules and could not give details of the content of the cargo .
Spokesman Themba Maseko stated as long as administrative papers are in order South Africa cannot intervene to prevent weapons being transported through South African territory to Zimbabwe .
Defense Secretary January Masilela confirmed to South African radio that the National Conventional Arms Control Committee granted approval for the transit of the weapons .
January Masilela stated that if the buyer is the Zimbabwean sovereign government and the seller is the Chinese sovereign government , South Africa has nothing to do with the transaction because South Africa works according to established international conventions which allow the nation no jurisdiction over goods in transit .
Sydney Mufamadi is the government official who approved the transit and he is the same official who heads the team mediating in the Zimbabwe crisis .
Themba Maseko stated that the situation in Zimbabwe is dire because elections are held and results are not released 2 weeks after .
This was the strongest comment on Zimbabwe so far by the South African Government .
On April 17 , 2008 Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai called on South Africa and President Thabo Mbeki to step aside as mediator for Zimbabwe in favor of Zambia 's president , who has taken a tougher stance toward Mugabe .
Afriforum criticized the decision to approve the arms shipment .
Afriforum is a lobbying group representing mainly white South Africans .
Afriforum stated that the group would organize protests along the route to Zimbabwe .
Kallie kriel of afriforum stated that the South African Government 's approval for the transport of the arms across South African territory will in effect mean that the Government is replacing an ineffective policy of silent diplomacy with an even more catastrophic policy of complicity to the State violence and human rights violations committed by the Zimbabwean government against Zimbabwean citizens .
The South African Revenue Service stated that the ship would be subject to standard inspection procedures and the cargo would not be released until ithe cargo was proved to be compliant to customs formalities .
The approval process can be lengthy .
Zimbabwe is a landlocked country neighboring Zimbabwe ,

The report was due to the United Nations in 041000 .
The 080425 Security Council resolution stresses the need to enhance the coordination of national , regional and international efforts to strengthen a global response to the serious challenge of keeping weapons from terrorists and the threat to international security .
The 040400 Security Council resolution was adopted to close a loophole in global efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
International treaties targeted weapons proliferation by Governments until Resolution 1540 was adopted in 040000 there was no legal instrument to prevent terrorists , criminal scientists , black marketeers and other non - State actors from obtaining weapons of mass destruction .
Resolution 1540 was introduced as the International Atomic Energy Agency was investigating a vast black market in nuclear equipment and technology .
The black market investigation was encouraged by Pakistan 's admission in 040200 that Pakistan 's leading nuclear scientist had passed technology to Iran , Libya and North Korea .
Pakistan 's leading nuclear scientist , was Abdul Qadeer Khan .
Resolution 1540 requires all countries to adopt laws to prevent non - State actors from manufacturing , acquiring or trafficking in nuclear , biological or chemical weapons , the materials to make them , and the missiles and other systems to deliver them .
Resolution 1540 requires all countries to take measures to account for and secure these weapons , missiles and other weapons material .
Resolution 1540 also demands that countries develop border controls and step up law enforcement efforts to detect , deter , prevent and combat the illicit trafficking and brokering of weapons of mass destruction .

The Security Council stated that not all States have presented to the Resolution 1540 Committee the state 's national reports on implementation of Resolution 1540 and that the full implementation of Resolution 1540 by all States is a long - term task that will require continuous efforts at national , regional and international levels .
The Security Council stated that full implementation of Resolution 1540 by all States includes the adoption of national laws and measures to ensure implementation of the Resolution 1540 inspired national laws .
Dumisani Kumalo stated that many developing countries find the reporting requirements for Resolution 1540 and other resolutions onerous when they are trying to provide food , health care and jobs for the people of developing countries .
Dumisani Kumalo is the current Security Council president and South Africa 's United Nations ambassador .
Dumisani Kumalo stated that one of the things that South Africa is happy about is that countries must cooperate in dealing with the networks that may be spreading illict nuclear and other weapons .
The 080425 resolution was approved on the day that Mohamed ElBaradei angrily criticized Israel for bombing an alleged Syrian nuclear facility , chastised the United States for withholding information on the alleged Syrian nuclear facility , and stated that the International Atomic Energy Agency would investigate the allegations of the Syrian nuclear facility .

A leading arms expert stated that China 's improved nuclear arsenal raises questions about the Chinese government 's future arms control efforts .
The expert praised Beijing officials for decreasing sales of weapons abroad .
A leading arms expert stated on 8 May 2008 that Chinese government is making dramatic improvements to China 's nuclear arsenal which raises questions for future arms control efforts .
Director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Bates Gill spoke at a panel for journalists while on a visit to Beijing to promote an annual report on the global arms industry .
Gill stated --
Recent upgrades have increased the accuracy and mobility of China 's arsenal while a switch from liquid to solid fuel has shortened reaction times .
China stands out due to the effort to modernize , expand and improve nuclear weapons capability .
Among the 5 nuclear Powers China is making the most dramatic improvements in nuclear force which raises arms control questions .
The Chinese Government stated China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict and China 's arsenal , estimated at just over 100 nuclear - armed missiles , is the smallest of the 5 main nuclear weapon Powers .
Chinese officials signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1992 and gill stated the recent steps are aimed mainly at reducing the vulnerability of China 's deterrent force .
Gill stated that improvements in China 's conventional military are even more dramatic after more than 10 years of double - digit percentage increases in annual defense spending .
Gill stated the large increase in the military capability of China is targeted mostly at Taiwan but has the possibility going forward with force projection elsewhere .
Taiwan is a self - governing island that China claims is part of China 's territory and has threatened to invade .
Gill stated that the increase in military capability complicates the issue of China as a player in the arms control agenda and that the Chinese government would need to be engaged in future efforts to cap or reduce numbers of nuclear weapons .
Gill praised Beijing officials for decreasing sales of weapons and military technology abroad which Gill believes was largely done out of a desire to be viewed as a more responsible player in international society .
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute China has only a 2 percent share of the global arms export trade .
Gill stated that the shift in the way the Chinese government views the problem of nonproliferation is very positive .
Gill stated that authorities need to strengthen regulation to prevent weapons from entering conflict zones , particularly in Africa where Chinese arms are used by both government and rebel forces in Sudan 's Darfur region .
Retired People 's Liberation Army Colonel Teng jianqun spoke alongside Gill on the panel and stated that China has substantial restrictions on weapons sales abroad .
Teng conceded that some dealers violated the rules and were beyond the Government 's direct control .
Teng stated that further steps were being taken to boost awareness of the rules , partly through courses for government and defense industry leaders run by the foreign ministry - sponsored China Arms Control and Disarmament Association of which Teng is Deputy Secretary - General .
Teng stated a belief that the Chinese have been putting more effort into export controls .

Japan 's lower house APPROVES BILL allowing use of space programs in national defense .
The legislation is the most recent effort by Japan to ascribe more freedom to its tightly controlled military and would overturn a ban on the military use of space .
On 13 May 2008 Japan 's powerful lower house of parliament voted to allow Japan 's space programs to be utilized for national defense .
The legislation is the most recent effort by Japan to ascribe more freedom to the tightly controlled military technically known as a self - defense force .
The legislation is expected to be approved by the upper house .
The legislation is primarily aimed at permitting military use of Japan 's civilian - controlled spy satellite network for defense as defined by the pacifist constitution .
The bill states that space development has become increasingly important .
The bill states that space programs must contribute to ensure peace and safety of international society as well as the national security of Japan .
The bill does not specify how the programs will be utilized but the satellite network and other assets could potentially be used for surveillance , planning and for a missile defense shield Japan is constructing with the United States .
The bill would overturn a ban on the military use of space imposed on Japan 's nascent space program in 1969 .
The U.S. - drafted 1947 Constitution prohibits Japan from offensive warfare .
The legislation stipulates that all members of the cabinet and not just education , science and technology ministers will be responsible for Japan 's future space projects .
Inclusion of the defense minister in decisions on space programs introduces the possibility for the military to possess and develop spy satellites .
The legislation would establish a special space task force led by the Prime Minister and create the new post of space development minister .
Japan 's Defense Agency was upgraded to Ministry status in 2007 .
Japanese troops were dispatched to a combat zone for the first time since World War II in 2004 .
The mission in Iraq was strictly humanitarian .
Support .
Both the ruling coalition and the largest opposition party support the bill .
The nation 's largest newspaper Yomiuri approved of the bill and urged its quick enactment .
In a weekend editorial the newspaper Yomiuri stated that it is logical to use space development for national security and necessary to counter the threat of North Korea 's missile program .
Opposition .
Some pacifist lawmakers from the Communist and Social Democratic parties boycotted the vote on 13 May 2008 stating that the bill contradicted the principle of a civilian - controlled space program .
The left - leaning newspaper Asahi raised concerns that the legislation could escalate friction with neighboring countries .

7 NATO allies to sign agreement to create a cyber Defense Research Center in Estonia .
Experts from NATO member states will be recruited to conduct research and training on cyber warfare and will be prepared to assist allies with response to the growing threat of cyber attack .
7 NATO allies are prepared to sign a deal on 14 May 2008 to create a research center in Tallinn , Estonia to improve the NATO alliance 's defenses against cyber attacks .
Cyber attacks are considered a growing threat to military and civilian computer networks .
In 2007 Estonia experienced an unprecedented number of cyber attacks that disabled government and corporate computer networks .
The attacks occurred after a dispute between the Governments of Russia and Estonia over the relocation of a Soviet war memorial .
Many Estonians suspect the Russian government was responsible for the cyber attacks but the Government of Russia denies involvement .
Defense chiefs from Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Germany , Italy , Spain and Slovakia will sign the agreement to provide staff and funding for the center .
The United States will join the project as an observer and other NATO nations may join later .
Signing of the Agreement is a peripheral issue of the meeting of Chiefs of Defense Staff from the 26 ally countries of NATO .
The meeting is expected to focus on NATO missions in Afghanistan and Kosovo .
The generals will also discuss cooperation with Balkan and former Soviet nations including Russia and Ukraine .
The Cyber Defense Center will be operational in August 2008 with the formal opening planned for 2009 .
A staff of 30 specialists will conduct research and training on cyber warfare and will be prepared to assist NATO members with response to any future cyber attacks .
Head of the center major Raul rikk stated to the Associated Press in Tallinn --
The attacks against Estonia last year were cyber terrorism .
The mission of the center is to create new capabilities to fight new threats .
Experts will be recruited from various NATO member States and from various sectors including information technology , science , military and finance .
Estonia is 1 of Europe 's most Internet - savvy nations .
Estonia proposed creation of the center in 2003 but it was not until after the cyber attacks of 2007 that NATO leaders were convinced it was needed .
