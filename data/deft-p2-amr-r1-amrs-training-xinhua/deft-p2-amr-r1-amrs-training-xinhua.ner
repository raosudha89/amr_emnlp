On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> , the heads of the nine <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> countries and the heads of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> held an informal meeting in <LOCATION>Kuala Lumpur</LOCATION> , capital of <LOCATION>Malaysia</LOCATION> , on the 15th .
The next day , the heads of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> held informal meetings again with the heads of the <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> countries separately .
This informal meeting of heads of Eastern Asian countries , the first time in history , is a good start .
After the end of the cold war , <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> confronted new international and regional situations and comprehensively adjusted its development strategy and foreign relations strategy , and increasingly became a cooperative organization in the southeast <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> region based on economic cooperation and integrating politics , economy and security .
ASEAN , with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> , strengthened their cooperation and jointly planned development , becoming a force that holds the balance .
Therefore , the holding of the informal meeting of heads of the countries in eastern <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> possesses important significance in promoting cooperation between all countries , in safeguarding regional and global security , and in accelerating the development towards world multi - polarization .
The development of countries can not be separated from the region , and that of the region can not be separated from the globe .
Discarding old concepts and establishing new international political and economic orders conforms with the main trend of the times in which people of all countries demand peace , request development , seek stability and promote cooperation .
To correctly understand the relationship between economic development , political stability , social harmony and national security , to diligently promote all countries , regions and the whole world to travel on the road of peaceful development , to jointly discuss east Asian economic cooperation in the <DATE>21st century</DATE> and forecasting the future development of eastern <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> are subjects being discussed at this informal meeting of heads of state in eastern <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> .
Peace is a precondition to economic development .
Without a peaceful environment , any construction undertaking would be impossible to discuss .
Only when long - term peace is realized can the realization of sustained development be possible .
Therefore it is necessary to breed a new kind of security concept and to seek new methods to safeguard peace .
To establish relations between countries on the basis of the five principles , namely mutual respect of sovereignty and integrity of territory , non - aggression , non - interference in internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , is the political basis and precondition for global and regional security .
That all countries strengthen their mutual benefits and cooperation in the field of economy , open up to each other , eliminate inequalities and discriminatory policies in economic and trade transactions , gradually narrow the development gaps between countries and strive for joint prosperity is the economic basis for global and regional security .
That all countries promote mutual understanding and trust through dialogue and cooperation , and promise to settle disputes and conflicts between countries in peaceful ways is a realistic way to ensure peace and security .
This year some countries in eastern <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> encountered financial turmoil and have had some difficulties in their economic development , but the economic basis of east Asian countries is still good and advantageous factors for economic development still exist .
In the course of this meeting , leaders of east Asian countries unanimously supported the suggestion to expand local trade and investment .
It is believed that after reviewing experience and implementing proper adjustments , the economy of eastern <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> will definitely continue to move forward in development .
The east Asian countries are not entirely without conflicts and disputes .
But in order to safeguard fundamental benefits to the people of all east Asian countries , and to promote the lofty cause of peace and development for mankind , we must progressively strengthen the east Asian cooperation .
Chairman <PERSON>Zemin Jiang</PERSON> solemnly elaborated on <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's stand at this meeting .
He emphatically pointed out that " We should uphold the principles of mutual respect , equal participation , mutual benefit , and co - development ; we should strengthen cooperation in economy and technology , especially in the field of new high level technology , and establish reasonable regional economic structures , and form a mode of economic cooperation on the basis of learning from others ' strengths and offsetting others ' weaknesses , and mutual benefiting from advantages , balancing interests , and practicing non - exclusiveness and non - discrimination ; and we should strengthen trust , broaden common understanding , seek common points while maintaining differences , and resolve disputes appropriately through friendly dialogue and consultation to guarantee the region 's peace and stability . "
Everything is difficult at the very beginning .
With this good start , people have good reason to believe that the coordination and cooperation between east Asian countries will certainly show more hopeful prospects in the near future .

After the successful implementation of a " soft landing " , the rumbling train of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's economy is running forward smoothly at high speed .
" Proper , quick and stable " growth will become the main theme of this year 's economic development .
Official authorities revealed that this year the Chinese government determined that the economic growth rate was <PERCENT>8 %</PERCENT> and price levels will be controlled within <PERCENT>3 %</PERCENT> .
This means that the whole economic operation situation will maintain a healthy pattern of " high growth and low inflation " .
People in economic circles seem to be more optimistic about the economic outlook .
The growth rate , predicted by concerned experts of the <ORGANIZATION>State Planning Commission</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Statistical Bureau</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>China Academy of Social Sciences</ORGANIZATION> , is mostly 1 to <PERCENT>2 percentage points</PERCENT> higher than governmental plans .
Of course , to a relatively large extent , this depends on aggregate control of using monetary policy as a primary means , or in other words , under the major premises of general tightening , how financial control should timely and reasonably conduct fine tuning .
Moreover , the impact of <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> 's financial crisis should not be underestimated .
On the part of the government , the keynote of a moderately tight macro - economic policy will not be changed .
The key of the current economy is not striving for a higher growth rate , but is adjusting structures and increasing benefits so as to make macro controls which were implemented from the <DATE>second half year of 1993</DATE> obtain greater achievements and push the national economy onto a road of constant , rapid and healthy development .
Actually , as main obstacles that restrained economic growth in the past several years -- inflation and the " bottleneck " of basic industries have all been evidently relieved and the macro - economic situation tends to loosen , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's economic development is in a relatively favorable period .
This year , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> plans to create an effective pulling force to economic growth through maintaining a moderate and stable growth of investment , consumption and exports .
Fixed assets investments will grow by <PERCENT>10 %</PERCENT> this year , total volumes of retail sales of social consumer products by <PERCENT>10 %</PERCENT> and export growth by <PERCENT>8 %</PERCENT> .
At the same time , the financial deficit will be reduced by <MONEY>10 billion yuan</MONEY> .
After bidding farewell to the age of " the shortage economy " , relations between commodity 's supply and demand have changed from a " buyers ' market " to an integrated " sellers ' market " and competition will be intensified .
Hence , activating the consumer market , especially the wide rural market , cultivating consumer hotspots and new economic growth points appear to be particularly urgent .
Along with comprehensively implementing hardship relief measures taken towards large and medium - sized State owned enterprises , the pace of <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> owned enterprise reforms will be accelerated greatly , the dynamics of bankruptcies , mergers and assets restructuring will be strengthened , and enterprise deficits are estimated to decrease by <PERCENT>20 %</PERCENT> and a number of competitive large and medium - sized State owned enterprises will gradually form .
However , the large amount of worker layoffs that will accompany this will cause unemployment pressure to gradually increase .
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has determined to appropriately place laid - off workers and to strive to control the unemployment rate to within <PERCENT>3.5 %</PERCENT> through implementation of a large scale " re - employment " project .
According to estimates , after three years in a row of bumper harvests , if this year 's measures are effective , agriculture still has hope of achieving a good harvest .
Agriculture 's increasing production and peasants ' increasing revenues will create favorable conditions for inhibiting commodity prices and realizing the target of steady economic development .
Currently , the degree of dependence on the outside of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's economy has reached <PERCENT>42 %</PERCENT> , and the space of utilizing overseas markets and resources is in the process of expanding , but is more easily subject to the influences of the international environment .
Under the circumstances of a relative steady domestic demand , the pulling effect of the trend of foreign trade towards economic development is more striking .
Taking all factors as a whole , this year 's amount of foreign trade will be increased steadily , the import will be increased and the increasing speed of the export will be somewhat slowed down .
People in economic circles said that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> should adopt positive and steady measures to solve outstanding problems in economic operations , and special attention should be given to clear up bad assets in time and strengthen financial risk prevention .
Forecasting the Year of the Tiger , although <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's economic train will have ups and downs , as long as adjusted and controlled measures are at the right time and appropriate , it is believed that the train will move steadily along the preset track .

The amount of foreign investment actually utilized by <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has been increasing in successive years , creating an historical high in <DATE>1997</DATE> , and a number of projects with particularly intensified technologies and funds have appeared .
On the other hand , since <DATE>1994</DATE> and <DATE>1995</DATE> , the number of recently approved foreign investment projects and the contract sum has been continually decreasing , which will directly affect <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's foreign investment attraction growth rate in the period to come .
Experts concerned pointed out that , after high - speed development in previous years , decelerating of the rate of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> attracting foreign investment was normal .
However , at the beginning of this year , concerned parties announced that , for projects that had foreign invested , and which were in fields encouraged by <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> such as the new , high technology industry , infrastructure , etc. , the country would implement certain preferential taxation policies .
According to estimates , these policies would attract more foreign companies to invest in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .

Compared with the rapid growth of the past , the world economy has entered a period of adjustment .
He forecast that the real growth rate for the world economy this year would fall from the <PERCENT>3.9 %</PERCENT> of '97 down to <PERCENT>3 %</PERCENT> .
Nakamura thought that the rate of economic growth of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> 's countries and regions , with <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> being the most prominent , would slide downward to a large extent .
But , he said , for these countries the currencies already have devalued to a great degree , exports have recovered , and imports could decrease .
Because of this , he expected that their economies would slip downward to the lowest point in the next half year .
He estimated that the rate of economic growth in <ORGANIZATION>ASEAN</ORGANIZATION> would be about <PERCENT>4.5 percent</PERCENT> .
<PERSON>Nakamura</PERSON> said that the Japanese economy exhibited negative growth in the year '97 , and that in '98 , if it did n't adopt good economic policies , the economy would continue to be in negative growth .
He estimated it would be negative <PERCENT>0.5 percent</PERCENT> , plus or minus .
He said further that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's economic growth would also slow in speed , feeling the effects of the economies of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> being depressed and of the devaluation of these countries ' currencies .
But because <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's usual income and expenditures show a favorable balance , and in addition it has over <MONEY>100 billion US dollars</MONEY> in foreign exchange reserves , it is n't likely to sink into the crisis like the other Asian nations .

According to what has been reported in the Soviet " Science and Life " magazine , biologists in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> have discovered that a mold element in the cells of plants can not only control the propagation of plasmodium in mosquitoes , but can also kill mosquitoes .
This method will not pollute the environment .
Biologists mixed a mold element in the cells of plants with pearl powder to produce a granulated drug .
This kind of drug can slowly discharge the mold element from the cells of plants in water .
When mosquitoes feed , they suck the mold element from the cells of plants into their bodies .
Experiments have shown that adopting this method can reduce the chances of mosquitoes transmitting malaria down to 1/70th to 1/80th of the original ratio .

Premier <PERSON>Peng Li</PERSON> delivered a written speech to welcome the <ORGANIZATION>International Population and Development Congress</ORGANIZATION> .
He thinks that the Chinese government 's guidelines of planning , strategizing and implementation of the population problem and socioeconomic problems as one is correct , effective in its implementation , and successful .
<PERSON>Peng Li</PERSON> said that in the beginning of <DATE>September</DATE> of this year , the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> would hold the <ORGANIZATION>International Population and Development Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> with the theme of " population , continuous economic growth and continuous development " .
This shows that the international community has increasingly recognized that population and development are inseparable , and prepare to adopt actions together .
He feels that this <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has important meaning , and the Chinese government has given it high level attention and will be sending a delegation to attend the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> .
<PERSON>Peng Li</PERSON> said <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> was the most populous developing country in the world .
The Chinese government included the population problem into the overall planning of the national economy and its social development , always emphasizing that population growth and economic development need to fit together , and be coordinated with resource utilization and environmental protection .
In light of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's basic national condition , the Chinese government has determined planned parenthood and environmental protection as two basic national policies , implementing a population policy and planned parenthood program that suits <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's actual needs .
At the same time , the Chinese government also formulated a series of important policies and measures to realize continuous development , such as the protection of women 's legal rights and benefits , the promotion of equality among men and women , the forceful development of healthcare for women and children , the zealous elimination of poverty , and protecting the environment .
Presently , the Chinese economy is continuously growing , society is stable and united , people 's livelihood are continuously improving , and the population birth rate and the natural population growth rate has dropped to a lower level .
<PERSON>Peng Li</PERSON> said the population problem was one of the major problems currently faced by the international community .
Due to differences in country 's situations , differences in economic development levels , cultural backgrounds , historical traditions , and social systems , each country should formulate suitable , effective population policies according to the actual situation of the native country .
This is the sovereignty of each country and it should receive full respect .
He said <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> was in a critical period of building up a socialist market economy system and increasing the pace of its modernization build - up , but a huge , overwhelming growth in population was still restraining the social and economic development , affecting the further improvement of the living standard of the people , and has also brought about heavy pressure on the natural resources and the natural environment .
Because of this , for a fairly long period of time , at the same time as forcefully developing the economy , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> will continue to pay close attention to doing well the work of family planning .
The Chinese government strongly believes that , the resolution of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's population problem is not just being responsible for the prosperity of the Chinese race and the happiness of future generations , but is also an important contribution in stabilizing the world 's population .
For this , the Chinese government views with extreme importance and actively participates in international population activities , and sincerely hopes that the international community will adopt a stand of realistic resolution of population and development problems , seeking similarities while accommodating differences , co - operating closely to strive hard together towards a stable world population to create a beautiful future !
