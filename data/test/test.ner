Resolutely support the thread starter ! I compose a poem in reply :
Pledge to fight to the death defending the <LOCATION>Diaoyu Islands</LOCATION> and the related islands
Fleets bumping fishing boats . Little evil Japanese ghosts stirring up trouble and unrest . With hearts of thieves and arrogant form , they again show their wolfish appearance
Never go back to that time , our humiliating appearance when signing the treaties . China be strong , swords be sharp and knives be shining , let 's bury the approaching enemies !
<DATE>September 11th , 2010</DATE>
I agree with the analysis of the thread starter , resolutely bump up . If war really comes , I would like to be <LOCATION>Hua Mulan</LOCATION> , to protect our home and defend our homeland , to spread the prestige of our <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , to pledge to fight to the death defending our national dignity .
I very much wish I had been born in those passionate and upsurging times of <PERSON>Mao Zedong</PERSON> , the Long <DATE>March</DATE> , losing my head and shedding my blood , completely extinguishing all the enemies that wrong <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , spreading our dragon prestige !
How Long are We Going to <LOCATION>Tolerate Japan</LOCATION> ?
My fellow citizens :
Hello , everyone ! We all know the " <DATE>September 18th</DATE> " Incident , but now <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> again has a premeditated plan for another " <DATE>September</DATE> 18th " on the sea , another " <LOCATION>Lugou</LOCATION> Bridge on the sea " .
<LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> surprisingly defied the strong condemnation of the whole world , openly invaded our country 's sacred territory , " the <LOCATION>Diaoyu Islands</LOCATION> " .
As we all know , the " Diaoyu Islands " have always belonged to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> ; due to historical reasons , what originally belongs us has become controversial .
My fellow citizens , ours is ours , what need is there to negotiate ! <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> thus goes even further - wants to create a fact of occupation . Can we allow this ? No - absolutely not !
My fellow citizens , <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> 's militarism has brought the people of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> grave disasters .
Especially <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> suffered the ravages of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> for as long as several decades .
In the <ORGANIZATION>Northeast</ORGANIZATION> , Japanese Unit 731 cruelly conducted human body experiments on living people of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and other countries , the method of which were extremely brutal ; the <ORGANIZATION>Nanjing Massacre</ORGANIZATION> added a layer of blood to the ancient capital which will never fade away ; the big bloody battles at <LOCATION>Hengyang</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Changsha</LOCATION> laid bare the bones of the dead over a thousand kilometers and killed off everything ...
My fellow citizens , of the heinous crimes committed by <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , there are too many instances to cite , difficult to record without exhausting all bamboo strips .
It 's just as if those ten million deceased souls who lost their lives are wandering over the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION> , finding it difficult to rest in peace .
All the people who experienced that era must still remember it vividly ; even our younger generations also will cry with tears streaming down our cheeks , and our blood boils with indignation , whenever we turn to this page of history and read !
Now <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> actually wants to reverse the verdict on the history of its aggression - fellow citizens , fellow Chinese in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> , wake up !
Although it is painful to look back at these hundred years of shame , we must go face it ; although historical issues have not been resolved , let us create and choose history !
Since there is responsibility , we are not afraid . The territory is small , but it is related to the matter of dignity ; no matter how the winds and clouds changes , the interests of the country and national unity are the guarantee of honor ; even though scarred with wounds , we can not let our native lands be separated !
My fellow citizens , for the Chinese nation , the advent of the twenty - first century means a time when we are beset with difficulties inside while being pressed from outside , and we will face many challenges .
The <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> issue , the <LOCATION>Tibet</LOCATION> issue , the <LOCATION>South China</LOCATION> Sea issue , the surrounding environment , as well as the foreign forces which are aggressive to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> - which way should we go ?
What to do , fellow citizens ? Please take a look at the map of the world , that crescent - shaped encirclement is suppressing our breathing , strangling our development , and coveting our national territory .
We do not want to make enemies , but are never afraid of enemies ; we do not want war , but are never afraid of war .
We must urgently arrange arms , strengthen all military forces on land , on sea , and in the air .
Over thousands of years , the Chinese nation has flourished several times , but before it has never had ambition to expand its territory outward .
Not imposing on others what we do n't want ourselves , what we follow is a foreign security strategic philosophy which applies benevolence and virtue .
The tolerance and liberalness of a country are like those of an individual - we avoid hurting others , but must insist on not being hurt ourselves .
Tolerance is certainly not fear , and sincerity does not have to be cowardice .
<LOCATION>China</LOCATION> exempting <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> from war reparations for World War II was in service of peace , benevolent peace .
My fellow citizens , the <ORGANIZATION>People 's Heroes Monument</ORGANIZATION> is a condensed history of the Chinese nation striving for continuous self - improvement
The solemn and magnificent posture represents a sacred expectation for peace .
The thought - strings of my memory have been agitated from time to time - many heroic , stirring , and tragic scenes of shining spears and armored horses <DATE>spring</DATE> up in my mind .
My thoughts go through those yellowing pages of history , as if I saw <PERSON>Emperor Kangxi</PERSON> , the famous ruler of a generation , contemplating alone about how to achieve unification of the territory in his audience hall , hundreds of years ago ; also as if I saw <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> , former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> President , wandering alone in the dark of a great hall , thinking about the integrity of the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> .
" Although it is peaceful throughout the world , it is certainly dangerous to forget war ! " My fellow citizens , we want development and peace , but we must never exercise forbearance blindly . The " Boxer Protocol " of national betrayal and humiliation has aggravated <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's poverty and backwardness in modern time - falling behind will lead to being bullied .
Without strength , where does peace come from !
We must focus on national defense education , build up a Great Wall in the hearts of 1.3 billion people , and must establish the full range of a national defense system having the ability to both attack and defend ;
The best defense is to attack - we should strengthen forces which can engage in ultra - long - range attack , improve combat capability throughout all of aerospace , of great depth , and over great distances . On the premise of avoiding influence on national economic development , increase investment and construction of the defense industry , accelerate modernization and internationalization of military equipment , and establish a high - quality , high - tech elite division .
The battle horn is about to sound , the people are already fully equipped and ready to go .
Without the people 's support we will accomplish nothing ; with the support of the people , we will be all - powerful .
My fellow citizens , it is time for us to say " no " to others . Therefore , we must achieve :
1. Establish guaranteed funds , improve working environment and mechanisms , recruit back to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> the hundreds of thousands of IT professionals who have emigrated to and linger in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and around the world .
2. Create a few nuclear - powered aircraft carrier battle groups .
3. Manufacture 5000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds .
4. Accelerate the research and deployment of high - speed intercontinental ballistic missiles which can break missile defense systems and whose range is more than 10,000 nautical miles .
5. Resume nuclear experiments , and establish military forces in space .
6. Retain 1000 nuclear bombs equivalent to <MONEY>ten million tons</MONEY> of <ORGANIZATION>TNT</ORGANIZATION> , and when necessary , install nuclear warheads on all short - and middle - range missiles .
7. Retain 30 strategic nuclear submarines with the ability to inflict three devastating nuclear strikes against enemies .
8. Abandon the commitment to not use nuclear weapons first .
9. Retain the right of pre - emptive strike when national security is threatened .
My fellow citizens , only if we have self - confidence and self - improvement , can we strive to be strong . Qin <PERSON>Shi Huang</PERSON> unified <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> . Zheng Chenggong recovered <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> . In our responsibilities we must carry on the farsightedness , insight , and strong will of our predecessors .
Now , that piece of land trembling far away from the embrace of the motherland is shaking , moaning , and calling . Fellow citizens , let us carry forward the unfulfilled wishes of previous generals , moving forward courageously !
When reading over history , the heaviness and anger in my heart simmer into concern for the nation . Although I was born to cloth gown and am one of the common people , for the prosperity of the motherland , for the motherland being splendid once again , I am willing to voluntarily serve our country , and I will have no regrets even if I die ! My sincere patriotic heart is adequate to show to heaven !
Here , I 've composed a poem in classical ci form , to voice the aspirations of my heart .
Paint the deep red lips
Protect the <LOCATION>Diaoyu Islands
Bitterly</LOCATION> lost our <LOCATION>Ryukyu Islands
How</LOCATION> can we allow the <ORGANIZATION>Diaoyu Islands</ORGANIZATION> to fall to other countries
One hundred years of vicissitudes
Smoke and clouds chase the flying waves
Youngest brother is still a tender youth
Wandering in all directions , bearing a seal
Looking over to the flag
Brandish our weapons and cross to the east
Let the horses drink from the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION>

Why do n't we fight with little <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> ?
What do Chinese still tolerate ...
They are riding even on our head
Is this still what Chinese with guts do ?
We should tell the whole world , that Chinese ca n't be bullied at will by others ...
It is time to show our strength ! <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has been calm for too long !
Currently our citizens ' lives are all too carefree ! The officials are too extravagant .
Now we already have no cohesion ! <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> needs to start a war ! A harsh slap in the face of the countries which follow the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> ' rear !
Let them know that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> is not a panacea ! If we win , it may increase <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's influence ! and improve the cohesion of the citizenry ! If we lose , we can clean out those incompetent bureaucrats , and make those trash get out ! Let <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> have new blood and get updated . , Get up , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> !
Go , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , go
I suggest that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> strengthens the guard on the <LOCATION>Diaoyu Islands</LOCATION> , make it daily , protect the fishermen and the sovereignty of our country ; if <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> dares to invade our territory with military force , we will fight a small - scale war of self - defense , regardless of the cost . China can not lose !
We need shows in life , but it is really p. to show yourself within someone 's embrace .
I 'm just passing by
The whole society is like this , not to mention the stars
Damn it being not sexy
It 's totally unacceptable
Agree , just cheap entertainers . Their reputation in feudal <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> somewhat makes sense .
Their life looks glorious
a group of people of nine professions
Life is hard .
shocked :
That 's normal , it has always been the case that a whore is heartless and a performer is unrighteous
They want money , not the face
Have a look at the " wolf with glasses " near Ms. Fan , you will know the actress has no choice but drink with him or she will be forced out or even framed .
SOB
It 's ok as long as there is something to eat : loveliness :
No one is easy . Life is like a show , you must have a look at the script to know how to perform
All are SB
There are top scorer in the Imperial Examination in all 360 walks of life ! What effort and endeavor behind those top scorer in the Imperial Examination ! This is humiliating the word " bean vermicelli " !
Haha
Overdoing
The reality
Shoot those hooligans
Cheap performers
Cheap performers !
The entertainment circle is a dirty one , all men in it are birds and beasts and scum
Pity them , but who is to blame ? Those female stars are not easy
Everybody is doing this , how can you make money if you do n't do this
She is a proud woman in front of others but is in melancholy mood when staying alone ...
To put it plainly stars nowadays are just popular prostitutes in ancient times . Now that they are famous prostitutes , it should be just normal to drink with some high officials or even sleep with them
Stop talking about others just behave yourself
What should we do in the future ! Ability alone is n't enough to become successful ! Are we goin ' to face such hard choices too ?
More suffering is under the disguise of glorious looks , ' tis the undisputable fact .
It 's not so bad , they 're just playing in their own circle , out of sight , out of mind ,
Not like the old guy <PERSON>Zhang Jizhong</PERSON> not only behaved like a hooligan in his own circle , but also thinks he is virtuous without any talent . He makes TV series when he has nothing to do to wreck people of the whole country .
Both take what they need
When can <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> have a pure , innocent girl ?
A story is now very shocking in the entertainment world . It is rumored that <PERSON>Hsu Yuki</PERSON> has been forced out because she refused to drink with a guest as arranged by the company and has to switch to work as a lawyer 's assistant instead to make ends meet .
Much envied super stars often encounter social engagements or circumstances which they do n't welcome but have to join in ,
After all , there are many things they ca n't decide themselves ' cause that will have to do with many aspects and the interests of many people ,
Sometimes a dinner party which seems very normal for us ordinary people may not be that simple for stars as we imagined .
A star will have lots of contracts and her source of money will be rolling if she tackles well ; If she does n't tack well , what comes after her heel would be forcing out or even frame - ups ...
There are two kinds of smart female stars . Those of the first kind always hold very high integrity and sternly reject all such invitations ;
he second kind are good at playing the trick and making their objectives achieved with their seed money ,
It 's rumored that even some super female stars won their first roles in this way .
After drinking some alcohol , the advertiser or show sponsor may take the chance to lie on the female star 's shoulder , feel her chin or kiss her cheek , and endurance is the attitude most adopted by the female stars .
They are the very people of lower nine professions
Those stars are just pretending , they are all actually living a much damned better life than this
Agree , just cheap entertainers . Their reputation in feudal <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> somewhat makes sense .
Agree !
Ah well , it is not easy to be an actress
They deserve it . They asked for that .
It dawned on me nothing is easy !
The women are birds and beasts , and the men are worse than birds and beasts
Braawwk !
Braawwkkk !
It did n't take long .
Route 288 , the circumferential highway running around the south - western quadrant of the <ORGANIZATION>Richmond New Urban Region</ORGANIZATION> , opened in late <DATE>2004</DATE> .
Already it is changing development patterns for the worse and causing localized traffic congestion around its exits .
The <ORGANIZATION>Richmond Times</ORGANIZATION> - Dispatch tells the tale today about the impact on the <ORGANIZATION>Huguenot Trail</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Powhatan County</LOCATION> .
Traffic has more than doubled in one section of Huguenot Trail since 288 opened , reports Will Jones .
Speeding and accidents have surged as well :
17 accidents have been reported near the intersection of Winterfield Road so far this year , up from 12 for all of <DATE>2004</DATE> .
<PERSON>Dale Totten</PERSON> , resident engineer for the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION> , noted that VDOT would four - lane the road for about <MONEY>$ 13 million</MONEY> if it had more money .
Of course , VDOT has no more money for road construction in the <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> region .
One reason is that VDOT , at the behest of local politicians and boosters , spent all its friggin ' money on 288 !
Where 's <PERSON>Homer Simpson</PERSON> when you need him ?
This is a major " D'oh ! " moment .
As we predicted , Route 288 is generating residential development in scarcely populated areas all around its exits , overtaxing the local country roads .
While the limited access highway might provide limited traffic relief for people driving back and forth between <ORGANIZATION>Chesterfield</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Goochland</LOCATION> counties , other people are making choices about where they live and work ,
and they are creating traffic congestion in new places .
The only thing that surprises me is how rapidly this is happening .
Even I thought there might be a lag of three or four years .
If Route 288 has already created a <MONEY>$ 13 million</MONEY> road - construction in just this one exist , think of the liability it has created for all of its exits !
Here 's another prodiction :
After a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval of mega - commercial projects at major 288 intersections , the need for new road improvements will soar .
Before the end of the decade , we may well see the unfunded liability zoom well past the original <MONEY>$ 400 million</MONEY> it took to build the original highway .
To the brainiacs who thought Route 288 was such a great idea :
Thanks for nothing .
I think we could have spent the <MONEY>$ 400 million</MONEY> better elsewhere .
I do n't think you can blame 288 for creating those people .
If there enough of them to create new traffic congestion in new places , then what is the alternative ?
Additional traffic congestion in old places ?
Now you understand how people like TMT in <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> feel .
I 'd usually take the pro - road position -
but with the glaring needs in other parts of the state , 288 was definitely excess ...
You have a city , <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> , that has virtually no traffic .
The rush hour is 30 minutes long ...
And you give them a beltway through a largely rural area .
A road to no where ...
Just think if this money had been spent on another potomac crossing or road improvements that are desperately needed in NOVA ?
<LOCATION>Virginia Centrist</LOCATION> , To add insult to injury , the rest of the state helped pay for 288 in last year 's budget deal -- wiped the slate clean of debt .
It was very nice of y'all to oblige us .
Did n't make much sense , though .
It 's the same old problem .
If you get out ahead of the need you are accused of causing sprawl .
If you build where the need is already acute , then the claim is you ca n't pave your way out of congestion .
Anonymous -
That 's a fair point .
5:26 makes a good point .
However , this situation hammers home the validity of the state auditor 's report finding that the <LOCATION>CTB</LOCATION> and VDOT fail to fund transportation projects based on a comprehensive state transportation plan , but rather , based on whoever does the best job of lobbying .
I submit that this is a disgraceful situation that should not be tolerated .
Moreover , <PERSON>Senator Chichester</PERSON> and his toadies would make this worse by pouring more money into this flawed institution .
What is the purpose of transportation - related expenditures ?
In <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , it 's to benefit private business plans and not to serve the public interest .
You all are dead wrong .
No less than <PERSON>Walter Stoch</PERSON> stated that 288 money was intended to be paid from economic development money .
Come on folks !!
TMT : I do n't understand your point .
when was the last time you were stuck in traffic that you were n't on your way to or from some sort of business ?
It seems to me that the whole point of roads is to facilitate the public interest in getting to and from private businesses .
Then , of course there is the <DATE>sunday</DATE> drive , the trip to grandma 's , and the soccer games , but still , the overwhelming need is to support business .
Since our road expenditures nowhere near match the increase in business or state domestic product , it is no wonder we suffer congestion problems .
If we recognize that roads primaarily benefit businesses then we should do two things :
let business pay for more of our transportation bill , ( which they will pass to us , of course ) and incentivize them to locate where they put the least stress on the system , even if that means more overall travel .
Why is it so hard to understand ?
The solution is functional human settlement patterns and a balance between transport system capacity and land use generated travel deman .
All else is spin .
EMR
TMT said " In <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , it 's to benefit private business plans and not to serve the public interest . "
I do n't see the point of this statement because it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else .
I think they are so tightly intertwined that they are virtually one and the same .
Obviously there are local problems because this cookie dough is lumpy ,
but in the aggregate if we demonize business long enough we will eventually find out we all work for the Devil .
I do n't see there is any point in claiming as " a solution " a balance that is dynamic and ever changing in nature .
Even you see rail to <LOCATION>Dulles</LOCATION> as a positive because <LOCATION>Dulles</LOCATION> is a job center that promotes bi - directional demand on the rail .
I agree .
In fact that may be sufficient reason to build it , all by itself .
All I 'm saying is that the exact same logic should apply to roads :
hey should have destinations at both ends in order that we get maximum use out of our investment :
we need more places in order to get closer to the balance you say we need .
Reality check here -
I drive past <PERSON>Watkins</PERSON> Landing every morning and evening .
I commute back and forth to work on the <ORGANIZATION>Huguenot Trail</ORGANIZATION> .
I 've never seen anything remotely resembling a " flood " of traffic .
It 's a 55 mph zone - <DATE>75</DATE> to 100 cars in " a morning " - over how much time ?
The Huguenot Trail road widening was already planned , due to the heavy demands of development on the Chesterfield side , the new schools , and a whole bunch of existing developments that were zoned years ago and at that time funneled through Robious Road .
288 , for those of us that actually use it , is wonderful - instead of Powhatan and <ORGANIZATION>Western Chesterfield</ORGANIZATION> being bottlenecked by lack of roads ,
we can actually get some commercial development and have the ability to work closer to where we live .
You may think that 's not rational land use .
I have no desire to live in any city ,
I will not work in a downtown area ,
I will not use mass transit , which is not safe for female commuters that work long and irregular hours ,
and I happen to LIKE large lot development .
How exactly I 'm supposed to keep horses on a 1/4 acre lot is beyond me .
Gas could go to <MONEY>$ 10</MONEY> a gallon
and I 'd still pay to live in the country .
Many people have legitimate preferences - horses , hunting , gardening , certain types of small business - that makes them NOT want to live in an urban core .
This infatuation with city living truly baffles me .
Anonymous 6:37 , You have every right to live in the country if that 's where you wish to live .
But you do n't have a right to have the rest of the state to underwrite construction of a <MONEY>$ 400 million</MONEY> highway to make it easier to shop and get to work .
What 's consistently overlooked in the debate ovre 288 is what else that <MONEY>$ 400 million</MONEY> could have been spent on .
How much traffic congestion could have been alleviated had the money been applied to other pressing road projects or , god forbid , even non - road projects .
<PERSON>Ray Hyde</PERSON> - My comments were directed at investors who lobby to place roads near where they own property and the incompetent system that funds these requests without regard to their link or lack thereof to a master transportation plan .
I am 24 and a mother of a 2 and a half year old .
Me and my son 's father have been broken up since <DATE>August</DATE> .
I want to start dating other people and my son 's father says if I do he will have nothing to do with his son .
He is very possesive and controlling but he has no right to be as we are not together .
He has too much going on in his life right now and he thinks we can work when I have told him several times I dont love him and he does not love me .
I want him to be there for his son without needing me too .
But he has no one his family and him dont get along and have their own issues .
I do n't want to be miserable anymore and the longer he is around the more miserable I will be .
I dont want him to not be there for his son as he is a good father or he at least tries .
I do believe every child needs both parents weather they are together or not .
But he thinks if he cant have me no one can .
What do I do to move on with my life .
Your ex is threatening you using your son ... bad , bad , bad .
You ca n't give in to that or it will just escalate .
You have a right to live your own life and be happy , so do n't cave to his threats .
If he really loves his son , he 'll see him regardless , but this is just a typical control method that people like him use .
Others say things like , " I 'm going to kill myself if you leave me " ... get it ?
Date .
Meet all kinds of people .
Do what you want .
If the price is , he voluntarily walks out of both of your lives , you 're probably better off without him .
I 'd agree - one other thing it is none of his business whether you date or not .
I would n't tell him .
Not because of his threat - but because your personal life is none of his business .
Can you document his threats ?
You really need to .
Quit taking his calls , make him leave voice mail .
Make him email or text you .
Keep those records .
Get a lawyer and get a divorce .
If you ca n't afford one , try legal aid .
Tell your ex that all communication needs to go through the lawyer .
The bus drivers want exact change , the till people want exact change , the people who deliver your food want exact change ...
Do they not realise that you do n't get piles of change from the bank ,
someone somewhere is going to have to take the notes ?
People are getting lazy .
I do like to get as near as possible as i woud n't like to be couting coppers all day
ake a GBP 20 note on the bus , they just tell you to get on cos theyre lazy as hell
its illegal to pay certain amounts in loads of coins . such as you can only pay something like 30pence in 1ps
Hello I started university in <DATE>September</DATE> , did n't immediately gel with it obviously like most people .
However , I knew it would take me some time to adjust , because I have always been very introverted , and shy and especially anxious and all the rest of it .
The first night I was here , all my housemates and I went out and it was the hardest thing I have ever ever had to do .
To go into the SU bar on my own , sober .
Anyways more to the point ; Here are the facts :
- I am not enjoying university having been here 5months or so ; I 'm disillusioned by the course , not enjoying the projects set , and I do n't like the course delivery as much .
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> made out it was much better than it seems .
- I had a bad start to the first term ; student finance was delayed , adding to my stress levels , I was so worried I was unable to progress with work , conclusively it all piled up .
- I was assigned a counselor through the university ; had seen her for about 5-6weeks ( block sessions ) , if I 'm honest it did n't really work ; because I was never open with her .
Only half - halfheartedly .
- Now the work - load is up to my neck , I have major deadlines to hit , I am depressed , the anxiety is resulting in me feeling miserable all the time .
In no longer have a counselor because you can only have them for so many sessions at a time , and I doubt it will help much this time , if it has n't already .
- I lack motivation , do n't feel comfortable with any of my lecturers , feel like I want to give in , but ca n't bring myself to it , because I will end up in a dead end job , and I aspired to ' be someone ' .
- I would rather be dead than not be educated , and live a life I want to live ( and dropping out of uni would make matters worse ) .
- I 'm 21yrs old ( turn 22 this year ) , do n't have much time left for failing need to do something .
I failed college once over , did another course so I could get to uni do n't want to go through the system over and over and consistently fail .
Can someone please give me some advice please ?
Perhaps go and see your doctor , and see if there 's any way you can get your deadlines extended to try and ease the pressure a bit ?
Send your tutors a similar email to this post ( do n't worry they 've seen it all before - some much more uncomfortable admissions too - I know as I used to work in a <ORGANIZATION>Uni Dept</ORGANIZATION> admin ) and they will consider mitigating circumstances .
Break your work into manageable chunks .
Concentrate on one bit of work at a time ( obvs the most urgent assignment first ) .
Do n't shut yourself off from your housemates , and well done for trying new things from the very beginning now keep at it !
I 'd reccomend you go and see your doctor too .
If you 've always been an anxious person you might benefit from speaking to someone ( my friend got therapy on the <ORGANIZATION>NHS</ORGANIZATION> for anxiety , so its really normal ) .
And try and get deadlines extended , if you 're honest I 'm sure your uni will allow it .
It 's getting hard to keep strong and keep carrying on with life .
My mum is getting divorced - she had a horrible time with my step - father and her new found freedom has sent her round the bend .
She 's epileptic and a manic depressive with a huge anger problem .
She 's horrible to me , constantly .
I ca n't cope with her outbursts and nasty hateful remarks when I 'm at home .
I 'm 18 , a full - time sixth former at a high pressure private school ( on a <PERCENT>95 %</PERCENT> bursary ) and I 'm at breaking point .
I ca n't do work at home , because she shouts at me .
So then my teachers get angry at me .
One minute she 's lovely , and it 's like having my mummy back , then the next , she turns into the most spiteful human alive .
I 'm not going to pass my A 2 exams , I 've already accepted defeat , that this year of my life is going to make me a failure .
Maybe I can come back from this , who knows . I 've got the most amazing university offers , but I ca n't even accept them - I 'll never make the grades .
I wish I could wipe her out of my life - things would be so much better without her .
But then , I think I 'm just being selfish .
But surely , my life is n't meant to be like this ?
It should be so much better . B
ut I feel as if I have no control over this downhill spiral .
And I do n't know what to do .
Thanks for reading .
It 's nice to vent .
You ca n't get her sectioned for that .
Does she even have a history of mental illness or a diagnosis ?
You do n't know for sure that you wo n't get good grades so accept places if you can .
Life throws * * * * at you all the time .
If it 's not someone in your family , it 's an outsider .
I had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad for a long 8 years before I came to uni and honestly , the only reason why I 'm here is because it was the only way out .
Work hard if you really want out .
Really sounds like you need support from somewhere else if she ca n't give it to you consistently .
You could call Childline or something similar ?
You could go to the library on saturdays and do a good 8 hours of studying there .
Is there a friend 's house you could go to - form a study group ?
So you want her sectioned cos she is a bit of a pain in the arse and you 've blamed all your problems on her ?
I know what you 're feeling .
My Mum was spat out of hell too .
I highly recommend taking up smoking
Oh grow up tsr and stop negging its was a joke !!!
I think over the last year or 2 i 've become a much weaker person and in a way have dulled down my personality inorder to try and make some friends at uni .
But being overly - nice to people has lead them to believe that they can say or do whatever the hell they want to me ...
hey show absolutely no respect .
e.g. i 'll say hello to someone from uni and they 'll ignore me , but 30 minutes later they 'll decide they want my help with some work ... and i 'll give it to them .
It 's causing alot of anger and distress in my life and is really starting to effect my concentration in uni .
has anyone got any experience in handling this sort of thing or how to go about gaining some respect again ?
Just say no.
Do it gradually if it 's not something you 're particularly comfortable with .
You could start with ' No , sorry but I 'm busy '
Of course , do n't go over the top with it lest you go in completely the opposite direction .
If , in your mind , you 're thinking no - say it .
When they start to realise that you 're not going to bend over backwards for them , they 'll start respecting you more .
well this is such a bad attitude really , of course you can be respected if you 're nice but not to the point where you just let them do anything to you , that 's not being nice it 's being a fool .
I do n't know if anyone will read this , but I just feel desperate and feel the need to tell someone .
This <DATE>September</DATE> I left home , and started at <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . I was incredibly anxious about doing this , but rather delayed thinking about it until I got here ! Now I 'm here , and have been for over two weeks , I feel terribly overwhelmed by it all and feel unintelligent and socially awkward .
I have been struggling emotionally for the majority of my life since moving to <ORGANIZATION>Secondary School</ORGANIZATION> , although I did lose my dad at around the age of 9 and always used to blame that for my feelings . I have had two periods of counselling in my life , over roughly 15 months from <DATE>December 2009</DATE> until around <DATE>March this year</DATE> .
I feel at the moment like the problems in my life are incredibly overwhelming , and are making me ever more doubtful of my always low self - esteem . I have no ability to concentrate on work , often find myself becoming very quiet in social occasions , and doubt myself over anything and everything .
Neither of my counsellers have diagnosed me with depression , and both have suggested I do not suffer from it , but it is a huge worry to me , as depression was the cause of my dad 's death , suicide .
I have tried to solve my problems before , and have found exercise and meditation particularly useful , and have also tried things like self - help books and tapes . But my general feeling , is , ' Is this what my life will be ? My one chance at existance , my one chance of being a young man , I am wasting it ! ' And these feelings are beating away at me .
I simply do n't know what to do , and when I think of things to do , I never follow through with it . Friends often say I 'm lazy , and I ca n't disagree a lot of the time . I feel like everything anyone could do to help , people have tried , and time and time again I fail .
Sorry to anyone whose read this jumbled mess , and I feel a bit like a self - seeking moaner , but I truly do feel desperate .
Its not uncommon for people 's existing feelings about themselves to become more intense when they are in new situations and feel the pressure to socialise with strangers and fit into new roles , i.e. being a university student .
I am not a health professional and I can only speak from personal experience which is why I strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional about your feelings and worries about depression .
Most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they first get to uni - you 're definitely not alone there . But I would really recommend that you get an appointment with your uni counselling services . It does n't really matter whether anyone has told you that you are depressed or not , you are obviously having some problems at the minute and could use some support - labels are n't as important as your experiences . Meditation and exercise are really helpful , so definitely try to do those . But yeah , you will have to engage with help and life in general to get somewhere - but do n't beat yourself up about feeling unmotivated to do anything at the minute , lots of people feel like this and hopefully it will pass as you begin to feel better . Being unkind to yourself will only make you feel worse - be kind to yourself and get some help .
Good luck .
I think a lot more people feel the same way as you do , but medicate themselves by using friends . Whilst it probably is n't a ' solution ' as such , being around friends whilst being depressed is definitely better than being alone and being depressed . Either way , if you fancy a chat , feel free to PM
If i were you id focus on an idol . Someone you aspire to ( not want to be them but someone who your admire and have respect for ) e.g. someone who came from a bad background and ended up successful and happy with a family and married etc etc
Focus on what you want to achieve in life , you havent stated what your studying , or indeed why .... is it because you wanted the experience ? Because your mum wanted yo to go ? Because u need a degree for the career you want to do ?
Either way , sum up why youre there and work your bottom off to get the best grades you can , cos once you get ur degree , you wil have something you can say " hey i didnt fail , it was hard work and i passed "

hope this helps
I 'm pretty much non - autistic ( not diagnosed with dyspraxia but I think the doctor misdiagnosed ) , but I walk on my toes nearly all of the time .
It 's more comfortable to me .
What made them decide toe - walking is a sign of autism since it seems so random and is n't always indicative ?
Well I might have signs of something on the autism spectrum but who does n't have one or two ?
You guys know what I mean .
Walking on toes can be a symptom of autism .
Having a headache can be a symptom of brain tumours .
Feeling tired a lot can be a symptom of leukaemia .
Symptoms do n't always apply but if they happen in a lot of cases ( which it clearly must do in this instance ) it 's worth noting , since otherwise nothing would ever get diagnosed .
I used to walk on my toes , but that was because I was born with strange toes that curled under and had to be straightened with surgery two years ago .
My brother 's autistic but I have n't noticed this with him either , but the spectrum is so broad and I myself probably have mild asperger 's because I have problems with communication and do n't pick up on social reactions / body language .
But then I do n't have a proper diagnosis and even having some symptoms might not mean you have a certain condition .
I walk on my toes not as much since years of being told not to .
I have dyspraxia .
So maybe you are dyspraxic or have short tendons .
People who do dance / gymnastics / ballet etc have it drilled into them , to the point where I find it more comfortable now = P
I would n't read too much into random " symptoms " like that
hello , i am a 12 year old girl ( 13 in two days ) who is addicted to self harming

hanks you for reading
Are you on any drugs or getting any therapy ?
It might be an idea to talk to your school nurse or your GP and tell them what 's going on .
Perhaps there 's a teacher at school who you trust and could tell .
If you tell people they can help you ,
if you keep it bottled up inside it 's likely to only get worse .
Trust me , it 's better to get these things as early as possible rather than let them get even worse .
Please do n't do this ,
I 'm 17 I started self harming <DATE>last year</DATE> , mainly cutting my arms , but I have stopped since the last few months ,
its hard but you can do it .
I feel so much happier , but seeing the scars is both a painful reminder of how I felt at that time , how strong my feelings were that I would want to do such a thing to myself !
And , also strength , you can do it , I found salvation in poetry writing and keeping a journal ,
self harming is addictive , but you can overcome it ,
remember your self harming does not define who you are .
You can overcome it .
So I think Ive got a form of <LOCATION>OCD</LOCATION> because for the past year , I 've found that everytime I go out , especially to Uni , I 'm always checking my belongings to make sure I have n't lost or left anything .
I often have to check twice at one go , then after 30 seconds for some reason I cant resist checking again !
Why is this ! ?
Am I going crazy or something ?
It happens most often when I 'm carrying many things , but that is rarely and even still daily I 'm checking many times . And is this <LOCATION>OCD</LOCATION> to any extent ?
What can I do about this ?
If I do n't check , I get very very anxious , which does sort of go away after 15-30 mins , but often the anxiety is so much that I ca n't wait that long .
I feel if I lost my wallet or phone , then I 'm doomed or so I feel .
I just wish I could go out without worrying every 2 mins whether I 've left or lost something .
I really dont know what to do , and am afraid of going to the GP .
They 've probably never heard of some compulsion like this and I just dont know what to do
Do any of you have a similar ' ritual ' ?
People would think I 'm crazy , but it 's very strangely difficult to get yourself out of this .
What advice could you give me ?
I used to do this on my way to college - I had a list of items I knew I had on me and used to check compulsively on the bus .
I now have more severe anxiety and think this was just a warning sign so just try and wean yourself out of the habit while it 's relatively fresh - definitely visit your doctor but also tell yourself not to keep checking these things ( easier said than done I know ) .
Doctors will have seen much worse cases so do n't worry about that !
I did about <LOCATION>OCD</LOCATION> in psycology today : P
To get rid of it , one way could be just to avoid the compulsive act so do n't check to see whether you have lost something , just leave it ( :
Even though your anxiety levels would increase for a duration , they will gradualy decrease so hopefully , overtime your OCD will disappear ( :
To me that just sounds like you being overly anxious , as opposed to having really bad <LOCATION>OCD</LOCATION> .
I am very obsessional to the point where I get up 20 times a night to check the locks in my house are all locked a particular way .
Sometimes although I know they 're locked I 'm convinced they 're not .
I think it becomes a real problem when the obsession starts to really interrupt your everyday routine .
You definitely are n't crazy though do n't worry and your GP will be understanding of the issue I 'm sure .
I go to therapy ( for other reasons also ) and they have encouraged me to pick a number of times to check , obviously that is less than 20 , and to stick to it and cut down that way .
I think the idea is to teach me , I 'm still ' okay ' if I check 5 times or 20 times .
So far I have been a lot better , I think there is definitely hope of improvement for anyone that wants it .
Usually I 'm pretty calm about things and like to take things as they come and not to worry too much .
However , over the last month or two I 've found myself becoming really anxious about things , and I 'm not talking about a mere out of the blue feeling of nervousness .
I have begun to feel irrationally panicky about a variety of things which beforehand would n't worry me too much or even cross my mind as something to cause alarm bells to ring in my head .
I 'm not sure if it 's the change in lifestyle ( going from care - free student to unemployed graduate ) that is causing this or if it 's a sign of other issues , but it 's beginning to bug me as it 's affecting my confidence and happiness .
I 've spoken to a few people about it including my parents but they all think the same : that I 'm going through a random phase and that I should hold off taking action until it is clear that it is a serious problem
So was wondering what 's the best thing to do ?
Speak to a doctor about it and see if anti - anxiety pills could take the edge off of things ?
See if I can speak to a counsellor ?
Or should I take the advice given by the close people around me and just keep an eye on the anxiety until it becomes a problem ?
Well I woudnt try to keep an eye on ur anxiety for a start because that will make u tense and more likely to become more panicky ( circle of demise there )
what I would try to do is focus on something that is garunteed to make you smile or feel happier as soon as you start to feel a bit panicky about anything .
Or if u cant do that - when you start to feel panicky , get one of your friends to make you laugh ( it works for me and i suffer from random panic attacks lol
This started happening to me , where I 'd just start being really anxious over tiny things , although from the sound of things , not as severely as you .
What I find helps is just talking about what is making you anxious to someone else .
Perhaps not in a moany way but I found that mentioning the thing that I was worried about to my mum and seeing her react to the situation in a calm way ( like I should have been reacting ) made me feel better about it because I knew it was n't a big deal and I did n't need to be anxious about it .
However , if it gets worse , then yes , go to the doctor 's .
I have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety that can prevent her from leaving the house and doing things because she 's so worried about what can go wrong .
The doctors gave her medication and it 's made her much better .

<ORGANIZATION>The International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> reached an agreement with Iranian officials that stated there were no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear program and activities .
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and European officials suspect that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's civilian nuclear energy program masks an effort to obtain technology that could be used in the production of an atomic bomb .
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and European officials suspect that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's civilian nuclear energy program masks an effort to obtain technology that could be used in the production of an atomic bomb .
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and European officials may impose a 4th round of sanctions on <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> when the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Security Council</ORGANIZATION> considers the issue of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear energy program most likely in <DATE>September 2007</DATE> .
The <ORGANIZATION>International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> distributed limited copies of the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> report before a meeting on 11 <DATE>September 2007</DATE> of the 35 members of the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> board .
The findings reflect an agency agreement on 21 <DATE>August 2007</DATE> with <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> that Iranian officials began publicizing the week of 12 <DATE>August 2007</DATE> .
The accord said that there were no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear program and activities .
According to an account by <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> news agency the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> report said the work plan is a significant step forward .
Reuters quoted a senior <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> official as stating the Iranian government 's efforts to enrich uranium had slowed .
The <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> report stated that Iranian officials must continue to build confidence about the scope and nature of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's present and future nuclear program .
Iranian officials on 30 <DATE>August 2007</DATE> stated cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> possibly to prevent a further round of international sanctions .
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's representative to the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH</ORGANIZATION> stated to <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Fars</ORGANIZATION> news agency that the report emphasized that there exists no sign or evidence indicating diversion of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear activities and that all of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear materials have been audited .
Some Nonproliferation Experts stated the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> was ceding too much to <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> .
Arms - control experts <PERSON>David Albright</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jacqueline Shire</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> - based <ORGANIZATION>Institute for Science and International Security</ORGANIZATION> wrote in a criticism published the <DATE>week of 19 August 2007</DATE> that the idea of closing files violates fundamental safeguards principles and that the agreement does not specify that Iranian officials would provide the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> access to key people , facilities , and documents that are needed to verify Iranian answers to the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> 's questions .
Independent experts stated <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's latest agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> which gives inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information falls short of the West 's demand to halt the production of concentrated uranium that could potentially be used for a bomb .
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman for the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration <PERSON>Tom Casey</PERSON> stated that while the report may offer some new details or insight into the development of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's program Iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program .
Casey stated the fact that the nuclear program continues to move forward shows that the Iranian regime is continuing on a path of defiance of the international community .
Most Western Nonproliferation Experts stated the Agreement on 21 <DATE>August 2007</DATE> contained little that could dissuade policymakers in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> from moving forward with another round of <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> sanctions .
Experts stated many of the transparency issues reportedly resolved in the Agreement on 21 <DATE>August 2007</DATE> should have been resolved previously .
Executive Director of nonpartisan <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> think tank the <ORGANIZATION>Arms Control Association</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Daryl G. Kimball</PERSON> stated the agreement does not address the problem that the Iranian government is pursuing an enrichment technology and capability that could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material .
<PERSON>Kimball</PERSON> stated the Iranian government 's design is to deflect criticism and pressure and to claim that progress is being made .
Iranian officials stated a possible reduction in collaboration with inspectors in the event of more sanctions .
The <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> has voted unanimously to impose sanctions against <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> but the penalties have been limited from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> demands under Chinese and Russian pressure .
SOLTANIEH stated in an interview with state - controlled Iranian television that the report and the measures taken make the intervention of any other international organization including the <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> irrelevant and unjustified .

proliferation ; technology ; international ; politics
Documents outlining the Israeli proposal to allow the international transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to nonproliferation rules were distributed to the <ORGANIZATION>Nuclear Suppliers Group</ORGANIZATION> .
The proposal may complicate the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration 's efforts to win an exemption for <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to engage in nuclear trade .
Israeli officials convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines allowing the international transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to nonproliferation rules .
Countries including <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> that have not signed the nuclear Non - <ORGANIZATION>Proliferation Treaty</ORGANIZATION> are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade which includes purchasing reactors , uranium fuel or yellowcake .
Documents outlining the Israeli proposal were distributed to the 45 - member <ORGANIZATION>Nuclear Suppliers Group</ORGANIZATION> ( NSG ) in <DATE>March 2007</DATE> .
The Israeli presentation was made in a nonpaper that allows for official deniability .
According to a letter from the Chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> on 17 <DATE>March 2007</DATE> the Israeli presentation was offered in the context of the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> 's debate over Indian officials ' bid for an exemption .
Among the nations that have not signed the Treaty only <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> would qualify for admission to the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> under the Israeli proposal .
The Israeli plan offered 12 criteria for allowing nuclear trade with non - treaty states .
1 criterion indicated <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> 's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and said a <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if <ORGANIZATION>the State</ORGANIZATION> applies stringent physical protection , control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons , nuclear facilities , source material and special nuclear material in the <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> 's territory .
The documents circulated on Capitol Hill in <DATE>September 2007</DATE> as the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration worked toward an agreement with Indian officials .
Executive Director of the <ORGANIZATION>Arms Control Association</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> <PERSON>Daryl Kimball</PERSON> stated the Israeli document could affect the debate over <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> .
<PERSON>Kimball</PERSON> stated --
The dynamics at the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> are that officials from the countries do not want to be obstacles to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> which is the largest country and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> which is the most powerful country .
Consensus on <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> will be difficult to reach when the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> meets in <DATE>November 2007</DATE> .
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> 's proposal gives officials from some countries reason to suggest an alternative approach to a specific exemption .
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> 's record is good and better than <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> 's in following international nuclear rules .
Despite ties between Israeli and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> governments the <ORGANIZATION>Bush Administration</ORGANIZATION> rejected the Israeli proposal .
The proposal may complicate the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration 's efforts to win an exemption for <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to engage in nuclear trade .
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON>Condoleezza Rice</PERSON> view the Pact as an important part of the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration 's foreign policy legacy .
The deal is controversial in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> must give approval .
Delays in winning approval for the <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> deal could have a negative effect on the administration 's foreign policy legacy with delay until an election year having the most negative effect .
<ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Tom Casey</PERSON> stated the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government views the <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> deal as unique and does not see the deal as a precedent for any other country including <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> .
Spokesman for the Israeli embassy <PERSON>David Siegel</PERSON> stated the suggestion that the Israeli government is demanding an exemption or linking efforts to any other issue including the <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> debate is grossly inaccurate .
Seigel stated --
The Israeli government has never asked the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> for any exemption to nuclear supply guidelines or made any Israeli - specific request of the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> .
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> is recognized as a full - fledged adherent to the <ORGANIZATION>NSG Guidelines</ORGANIZATION> .
The Israeli government has urged the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> to consider adopting a generic , multi - tiered , criteria - based approach towards nuclear technology transfers .
Some officials from <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> countries have previously suggested an approach like the Israeli plan .
If modification of the <ORGANIZATION>NSG</ORGANIZATION> Guidelines were to take place along the lines proposed by Israeli officials the nuclear nonproliferation regime would be considerably enhanced .

<PERSON>Ahmadinejad</PERSON> announces expansion of Iranian uranium - producing capability .
Iran refuses commitment to halt expansion but hints a possible future halt .
20080726 Iranian President <PERSON>Mahmoud</PERSON> ahmadinejad stated to scholars in the northeastern city of mashbad that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> had expanded its arsenal of centrifuges producing enriched uranium to over 5000 .
The statement was ahmadinejad 's first asserting an expansion since the 20080400 announcement that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> was approaching the implementation of 6000 centrifuges .
Iran articulated the goal of 50000 centrifuges operating at the enrichment plant near the town of <LOCATION>Natanz</LOCATION> .
The international community has demanded that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> halt the production of nuclear material .
Media reports differed on the number of centrifuges ahmadinejad cited .
An Iranian news agency reported that ahmadinejad stated <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> had <DATE>6000</DATE> working centrifuges but the agency subsequently removed the statement from the Internet .
Another Iranian news agency stated that ahmadinejad referred to 100000s of centrifuges .
Experts discounted the significance of ahmadinejad 's claim in the absence of information on the centrifuges ' functionality .
A Western diplomat in <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> speaking under condition of anonymity stated that the quantity of centrifuges is less important than whether the machines are operational and efficient but that ahmadinejad 's assertion will hinder a resolution of the diplomatic standoff between <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> .
Arms control expert <PERSON>Jeffrey G. Lewis</PERSON> of the new <ORGANIZATION>America Foundation</ORGANIZATION> think tank stated that the Foundation was aware of <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but the operational status of the machines is unknown .
Diplomats and arms control experts stated that the Iranian enrichment program is hindered by technical problems .
<LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear program aims to produce only electricity because nuclear weapon production contradicts Islamic principles .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the majority of Western arms control experts believe that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> is pursuing the capability to produce bombs immediately in the event of a decision .
Experts stated that producing weapons - grade uranium from reactor - grade material is relatively simple .
Ahmadinejad stated that after <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> resisted the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> 's demands for a halt in nuclear activities , the <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> still pursued the resumption of negotiations .
<ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> foreign policy chief <PERSON>Javier Solana</PERSON> recently presented <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> with 2 offers --
A <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> - endorsed package of incentives to cease enriched uranium production
A 6 - week pre - negotiation ' freeze for freeze ' period during which <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> would add no centrifuges and the West would refrain from promoting a 4th round of economic sanctions against <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>UN Security Council</ORGANIZATION> .
US officials repeatedly stated that no negotiations can begin before <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> verifiably halts all enrichment - related activities but the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration recently agreed to the ' freeze for freeze ' proposal and dispatch burns to <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> .
20080726 during talks in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> attended by <ORGANIZATION>US Undersecretary of State</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>William J. Burns</PERSON> <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> refused to respond to <PERSON>Solana</PERSON> 's offers .
The talks constituted the highest - level diplomatic contact between the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> for nearly 30 years .
Solana , burns and European envoys set a deadline for <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> to respond positively before initiating new sanctions including prohibitions on selling <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> refined petroleum products vital to the country 's economy .
Iranian officials refused to commit to stopping expansion or to observe the deadline .
20080726 ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> might potentially halt expansion at a higher number of centrifuges that previously expected and for over 6 weeks .
Ahmadinejad stated that the West had consented to the existing 5000-6000 centrifuges in operation provided that the number did not increase .
5000 centrifuges can produce sufficient nuclear material for a power plant or an atomic bomb if the material is highly enriched .
6000 centrifuges running continuously can produce sufficient weapons - grade uranium for 1 bomb in 6 months .
20080500 the <ORGANIZATION>International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> stated that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> possessed 3500 centrifuges in operations .

A diplomatic meeting in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> concludes with no agreement on further steps to pressure <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> to halt uranium enrichment at <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's facility in <LOCATION>Natanz</LOCATION> .
On 081114 diplomats stated to the media that American , European , Russian and Chinese officials at a meeting on 081113 in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> did not reach agreement on further actions to persuade <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> to halt uranium enrichment at <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's facility in <LOCATION>Natanz</LOCATION> .
Uranium enrichment is a highly technical process that can produce fuel for a nuclear power plant or fissile material for atomic weapons .
The 081113 meeting ended without any new measures to announce .
After the 081113 meeting the French foreign ministry released a statement declaring the international community had reaffirmed the importance of the dual - track approach of engaging diplomatically with <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and working towards sanctions .

A report released this week says <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> has made significant progress at <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's heavy - water research reactor facility near the city of <LOCATION>Arak</LOCATION> .
Iran 's heavy - water research reactor near <LOCATION>Arak</LOCATION> could eventually produce plutonium that might be used in a nuclear weapon .
Satellite images published by the <ORGANIZATION>Institute for Science and International Security</ORGANIZATION> show construction at the heavy - water research reactor facility near the city of <LOCATION>Arak</LOCATION> has progressed significantly between 080200 and 081000 .
<PERSON>David Albright</PERSON> stated that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's heavy - water research reactor near <LOCATION>Arak</LOCATION> has evaded the international security community 's notice .
<PERSON>David Albright</PERSON> stated that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's heavy - water research reactor near <LOCATION>Arak</LOCATION> is making significant progress according to the satellite images and that in a year and a half the heavy - water research reactor near <LOCATION>Arak</LOCATION> has progressed from building frames to a largely finished facility .

Iran stated that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> is pursuing nuclear technology to produce energy and conduct research .
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and its western allies suspect that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's efforts to produce is a precursor to creating a nuclear - weapons infrastructure .
Low - grade uranium production is legal under international arms - control regulations .
The latest developments in <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's nuclear technology development show the complex diplomatic and technical challenges facing the incoming foreign policy team of <LOCATION>United States President</LOCATION> - elect <PERSON>Barack Obama</PERSON> when it takes on the task of stopping <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> from mastering technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons .
The administration of <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> President <PERSON>George W.

A high - security Russian laboratory complex storing anthrax , plague and other deadly bacteria faces loosing electricity for lack of payment to the <ORGANIZATION>mosenergo</ORGANIZATION> electric utility .
A large repository of anthrax , plague and other deadly bacteria stored in a high - security Russian laboratory complex 100 miles south of <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> is facing the threat of loosing electricity .
An official from the <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> region 's mosenergo electric utility arrived recently at the Russian laboratory complex and threatened to turn off the electricity for lack of payment .
The Russian laboratory complex is a 90 - building campus and served as the location for <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> 's secret biological weapons program in the Soviet era .
An incorrect headline in the newspaper Izvestia stated that deadly viruses from a <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> regional depository threaten <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> .
There are no viruses at the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>obolensk</LOCATION> .
At <ORGANIZATION>the State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology there is every kind of deadly bacteria that was studied for use in the secret biological weapons program of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> .
A large virus repository is located in <LOCATION>Siberia</LOCATION> .
Both Russian and Western officials have stated that it is unlikely that any public health threat would result from a power cutoff at the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology .
Russian and Western officials have stated that there is enough uncertainty that they could not be positive a loss of power at the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology would not cause a public health threat .
General <PERSON>Nikolai N. Urakov</PERSON> stated by telephone that the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology has quite reliable systems of protection in case of emergency .
General <PERSON>Nikolai N. Urakov</PERSON> is the longtime director of the <ORGANIZATION>the State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology .
The State scientific center of applied microbiology has been working with Western scientists to convert the complex into a biomedical manufacturing site .
General <PERSON>Nikolai N. Urakov</PERSON> stated by telephone that the people at the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology are scared by this threat of a sudden shutdown of electricity because it is a kind of psychological pressure on the people at the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology .
General <PERSON>Nikolai N. Urakov</PERSON> stated by telephone that in the event of a power shutdown at the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology scientists must destroy all bacteriological experiments under way .
General <PERSON>Nikolai N. Urakov</PERSON> would like the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and Western countries that have contributed about <MONEY>6 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> dollars to the transformation of the former bioweapons complex to contribute another 500000 <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> dollars per year to pay the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology 's electric bills and arrears .
An American scientist who works closely with the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology stated that the Russian government was responsible for paying for the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology 's electric bills .
Western aid for conversion of General <PERSON>Nikolai N. Urakov</PERSON> 's one time bioweapons laboratory peaked in 970000 because it was learned that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> had made offers to the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology to purchase its expertise .
Russian scientists and military leaders who now depend on Western financing to destroy nuclear , chemical and biological weapons have been known to orchestrate a sense of crisis to increase financing .
American scientist <PERSON>Randall Lee Beatty</PERSON> is working on the conversion of the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>obolensk</LOCATION> .
Beatty stated that this threat to cut electricity to the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology is a crisis .
<PERSON>Randall Lee Beatty</PERSON> is a Director of the <ORGANIZATION>International Science and Technology Center</ORGANIZATION> .
The <ORGANIZATION>International Science and Technology Center</ORGANIZATION> finances approximately half of General <PERSON>Nikolai N. Urakov</PERSON> 's budget to support about 350 Russian biowarfare scientists and technicians .
<PERSON>Randall Lee Beatty</PERSON> stated that it is known that the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology has not paid its electricity bill for 14 months .
<PERSON>Randall Lee Beatty</PERSON> stated that the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology is one of the important archives for dangerous pathogens in the world and it would be a shame if those archives were destroyed for not paying the electricity utility .
Approximately 3000 strains of bacteria are stored at the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology and many of the bacteria are stored in cryogenic casks cooled with liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment by layered enclosures and oversize air - handling systems that all depend on electricity to function .
The greatest danger from a shutdown of electric power at the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology would be the defrosting of live germs that are currently preserved in a frozen state .
A biological warfare expert at the <ORGANIZATION>Monterey Institute of International Studies</ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON>Raymond zilinskas</PERSON> stated that the main threat from cutting power to the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied microbiology would be to the organisms themselves rather than that they might escape .
<PERSON>Raymond zilinskas</PERSON> stated that in the worst case the bacteria would be defrosted from minus 70 degrees and it would be a real mess to clean up afterward because it would not be known for certain whether all the bacteria was dead .
The confrontation between the <ORGANIZATION>mosenergo</ORGANIZATION> electric utility and the <ORGANIZATION>State Scientific Center</ORGANIZATION> of applied Microbiology in <LOCATION>obolensk</LOCATION> is another example of how the basic capitalist imperative for enterprises to be self - sustaining can clash in a dangerous way with the old remnants of Soviet weapons science .
Due to an overdue power bill in 000000 the <ORGANIZATION>Russian National Power Company</ORGANIZATION> cut off electricity to a strategic base where nuclear missiles stood on high alert .
The nuclear missile silos themselves did not lose power .
Armed troops marched to the substations and turned the power back on .
In 010100 and 010200 the national utility , <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> energy systems cut power to a number of military installations around <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> .
The military installations that lost power included the Russian space forces monitoring center on the <LOCATION>Kamchatka Peninsula</LOCATION> .
In most cases of military installations having their electricity cut off the electricity has been quickly restored .
Often investigations show that the tug of war with the utility forces the military to spend budgeted funds for electrical power instead of diverting money for other uses .
Some of the budgeted funds cut at times have included the building country residences for generals .

<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> to implement law allowing air force to target drug trafficking aircraft in Brazilian airspace .
US concerned over liability in the event of misidentification of a civilian plane .
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> announced that the air force will begin shooting down aircraft used in trafficking illegal drugs in Brazilian airspace .
The plan requires 8 precautionary steps before the order to shoot down a plane may be issued .
Prior to the policy taking effect late 20041000 a publicity campaign will notify ranchers and others of the need to file flight plans .
The Law to permit such an action was originally approved in <DATE>1998</DATE> but <DATE>1995-2003</DATE> President <PERSON>Fernando Henrique Cardoso</PERSON> never put the policy into effect .
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> dissuaded Cardoso from signing the decree out of concern that the accidental downing of civilian aircraft could expose the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government and companies to lawsuits .
20010400 the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> reduced previous support for operations targeting drug - running aircraft when a Peruvian jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed an American missionary and her child .
Relatives of the victims sued the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government and won a settlement due to the <ORGANIZATION>Government</ORGANIZATION> 's provision of intelligence and technical support to the operation .
A <ORGANIZATION>US State Department</ORGANIZATION> official stated --
US law may forbid assistance to countries that implement shoot - down laws under certain conditions .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> agrees with the Brazilian assessment that the threat posed by drug traffickers is both very serious and increasing .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government has consulted the Brazilian Government about the provisions of US law .
Brazilian Defense Minister <PERSON>Jose Viegas</PERSON> stated that <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> has encountered difficulties in securing US support for the plan but recent bilateral talks led to certainty that the decree would be accepted by the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government without exposing <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> to commercial sanctions .
Brazilian officials have expressed hope that the policy will be endorsed by the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> before going into effect .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> is scheduled to provide <MONEY>10.2 million dollars</MONEY> in drug and law enforcement aid to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> in <DATE>2004</DATE> .
Former air force chief and current Director of the <ORGANIZATION>Air Institute at estacio de sa University in Rio de Janeiro General Mauro Jose Miranda gandra</ORGANIZATION> stated that the measure was a courageous step by the Government but the impact may be more political than practical because of self - imposed restrictions by the Brazilian government .
Brazilian officials stated that the policy would be inapplicable against aircraft with children on board .
Viegas stated that the limitation was necessary .
Gandra stated that the provision undermines the decree 's essential purpose by granting immunity to drug - smuggling aircraft carrying children and thus introducing the possibility of kidnapped children being used as human shields .
Viegas stated in an interview in <LOCATION>Brasilia</LOCATION> that the government will use the law to more powerfully dissuade drug traffickers who have previously entered Brazilian airspace feeling unthreatened by the air force .
The Government was prompted to act due to the deteriorating public security situation with increasingly powerful and violent drug gangs in <LOCATION>Sao Paolo</LOCATION> and particularly <ORGANIZATION>Rio de Janeiro</ORGANIZATION> .
Rio de Janeiro drug gangs have more firepower than the police and have successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close .
President <PERSON>Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva</PERSON> stated in a <DATE>2003</DATE> interview with foreign correspondents --
The policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security .
Some pilots of drug - running aircraft felt so confidently immune from retribution as to make obscene gestures at pursuing Brazilian air force pilots .
The constitutionality of the law has been questioned under <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> 's prohibition of the death penalty as punishment for criminal acts .
Some legal experts and other commentators stated that contrary to government claims , the Statute amounts to a de facto execution of drug traffickers .
The daily newspaper O Estado de <LOCATION>Sao Paolo</LOCATION> stated in an editorial the week of 20040718-20040824 -- the extreme measure raises ethical and juridical problems exceeding any potential benefits .
The penalty will be applied extrajudicially by administrative decision of the Commander of the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> .
This person will gain life and death power over crew members and passengers of irregular flights .
In <DATE>2002</DATE> Brazil inaugurated the 1.4 billion dollar <ORGANIZATION>SIVAM</ORGANIZATION> radar system allowing the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansive <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> region for the first time .
The system uses American technology .
Illegal Flights initially declined <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> due to trafficker 's concerns about improved tracking capabilities but subsequently reaccelerated .
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> recorded <DATE>4128</DATE> unauthorized flights in <DATE>2003</DATE> .
Some of these flights were innocent violations by ranchers in the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> flying between plantations .
Viegas stated that there was a significant increase in deliberate violations of Brazilian airspace , apparently by drug smugglers realizing that the government was incapable of retaliation .
20010400 <ORGANIZATION>Rio de Janeiro</ORGANIZATION> 's most notorious drug boss , <LOCATION>Fernandinho Beira</LOCATION> - <DATE>Mar</DATE> , was captured in <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> in a guns - for drugs pipeline involving left - wing guerrillas .
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> 's northern <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> corridor has become an increasingly busy and essential route in the global drug trade and is used for smuggling arms , gold and diamonds .
Reportedly one of the most important drug - and gun - smuggling routes in supplying <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> with cocaine runs from <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> across the northern tier of the <LOCATION>Amazon</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Suriname</LOCATION> .
<LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> is the only country that currently has a policy of targeting drug trafficking aircraft .
<LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> is the source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .

The Venezuelan president 's weapons deals with <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , curbs on military cooperation with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , and his plans to train as many as <MONEY>2 million</MONEY> Venezuelan civilians to repel a possible invasion by superpowers have the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and his domestic critics worried .
Venezuelan president <PERSON>Hugo Chavez</PERSON> 's weapons deals with <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , curbs on military cooperation with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , and plans to train as many as <MONEY>2 million</MONEY> Venezuelan civilians to repel a possible invasion by imperialist superpowers have the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> 's domestic critics worried about what the leftist former military officer is planning .
Chavez insists that the moves are purely defensive and born of an overdue need to update obsolete military hardware and protect <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> from nations that might want to take control of <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> .
<LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> is <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> 's largest petroleum - producing state .
Chavez 's domestic opponents scoff at the idea that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> would ever invade <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> and charge that <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> 's true intention is to arm a huge cadre of loyal reservists who would protect <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> against any internal uprising and to pose as a militarized counterweight to <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> influence in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> .
Cuban leader <PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON> is <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> 's his major ally and <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> is growing closer to <PERSON>Castro</PERSON> .
Chavez 's detractors in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government say that it is even more troubling that <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> 's arms purchases and indoctrination of civilian militias could be part of a strategy to restructure Venezuelan democracy in the image of Cuban - style militarized socialism and foment leftist revolutions throughout <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> .
US military strategists say they are increasingly concerned that radical movements inspired by <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> could foment such revolution .
The political mainstream in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> has shifted leftward since the <DATE>late 1990s</DATE> .
This leftward shift is largely in reaction to the perceived failure of free - market economics .
Leftists have been elected to lead <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Uruguay</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> .
Chavez 's supporters at home counter that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has a century - long history of open as well as covert armed intervention in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> 's domestic politics and say that it has no right to question <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> 's defense preparations .
Carlos <PERSON>Roque Espinoza Leon</PERSON> said that Venezuelans never ask what the <ORGANIZATION>US Marines</ORGANIZATION> are doing .
<PERSON>Espinoza Leon</PERSON> is a pro - <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> defense specialist who serves in <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION> .
<PERSON>Espinoza</PERSON> said that <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> has 500000 rifles and no one says anything .
<PERSON>Espinoza</PERSON> said no one complains that <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> is the most militarized country in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> .
<PERSON>Espinoza</PERSON> said <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> history is full of aggression in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> .
<PERSON>Espinoza</PERSON> said Venezuelans have to do whatever is necessary to protect <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> .
Chavez has famously said that the Venezuelan so - called Bolivarian revolution is peaceful but not unarmed .
Chavez was first elected in 980000 and has a popularity rating of <PERCENT>71 percent</PERCENT> in an independent poll by polling firm <ORGANIZATION>Datanalisis</ORGANIZATION> .
Venezuelan military analyst <PERSON>Alberto Garrido</PERSON> said <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> is looking for allies in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> in order to promote a multi - polar world which will counteract US dominance and encourage grassroots Movements in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> to throw off <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> governmental influence .
<PERSON>Lorenzo Campos</PERSON> is a farmer in <LOCATION>Anzoategui</LOCATION> state in northern <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> and is training as a reservist .
<PERSON>Campos</PERSON> said Venezuelans want the world to know that Venezuelans are not preparing to attack anyone and that the mission is to protect <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> .
In <DATE>May</DATE> , <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> 's government announced details in 050500 of an <MONEY>$ 18.6 million</MONEY> deal with a Russian firm to purchase 100000 AK - 103 assault rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition each and the technology transfer for <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> to manufacture the rifles .
The deal works out to <MONEY>$ 186.22</MONEY> per rifle .
This price is considerably less costly than the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> mail - order price of <MONEY>$ 825</MONEY> to <MONEY>$ 850</MONEY> for the same weapon .
The Government of <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> also intends to buy 10 Russian helicopters , 10 Spanish transport planes , and 6 Spanish naval craft .
Venezuelan officials say the government is negotiating with <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> to buy around 24 air support and training planes .
Chavez has insisted and even his staunchest retired military Critics here agree that the purchases are essential to update old weaponry such as the military 's decades - old Belgian FAL rifles .
Retired General <PERSON>Fernando OCHOA ANTICH</PERSON> said that it is an exaggeration to say <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> is engaged in an arms buildup .
Ochoa was defense minister in 920000 when then - Lieutenant Colonel Chavez launched a failed coup .
Ochoa stated that <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> has n't purchased arms in 25 years and said and <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> is not aggressively buying weapons in a way that would threaten his neighbors .
<PERSON>Ochoa</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> has never bought Russian arms before and suggested <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> is doing it to become independent from the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> .
Ochoa asked why <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> is buying a caliber of rifle which is popular among subversive forces in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> and stated that the political support <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> gives to radical leftist movements makes <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> a continental menace .
The <ORGANIZATION>US Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> has openly questioned what <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> will do with the old <ORGANIZATION>FAL</ORGANIZATION> rifles and whether <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> might share weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government has provided no evidence of Chavez arming or funding leftist insurgencies .
Military analysts and specialists on the <ORGANIZATION>Colombian FARC</ORGANIZATION> guerrillas say the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and would not be interested in old Belgian rifles or in assistance from <LOCATION>Chavez</LOCATION> .
A 030000 study published by the <ORGANIZATION>US Defense Intelligence Agency</ORGANIZATION> reported that more than half of the weapons seized from Colombian guerrillas from 980000 to 010000 that had markings of foreign militaries were of Venezuelan origin .
The implication was that corrupt or sympathetic members of the Venezuelan military may be aiding guerrillas .
Perhaps more distressing to <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> 's domestic opponents is the ideological training that critics say <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> has in mind for the military and for new civilian reservists .
Chavez called earlier in 050000 for so - called Revolutionary units to start preparing the public to resist a superpower aggressor and said the first step would be to train from 100000 to 2 million volunteers in the coming years to back up active - duty armed forces .
Military analysts estimate <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> 's active - duty armed forces number 83,000 .
People 's defense units would be created in neighborhoods , <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> companies , and the <ORGANIZATION>Free University</ORGANIZATION> established under <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> and would report directly to the president .
The government insists the reserves will support the armed forces and not act as a fifth column against a possible anti - <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> coup .
<PERSON>Espinoza</PERSON> said the reserves are not to be used as shock troops for any political party and that if there were a civil war , it would be up to each person to take their own side .
General <PERSON>Julio Ramon Quintero viloria</PERSON> is commander of the reserves .
<PERSON>Quintero</PERSON> said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50000 civilians over 20 weekends in <DATE>the second half of 050000</DATE> and could train 300000 more in 060000 .
<PERSON>Quintero</PERSON> said that Venezuelans do n't want to be the colony of any empire and have to be ready for any possibility .
100000 reservists in 050600 engaged with the <ORGANIZATION>Venezuelan navy</ORGANIZATION> in a massive war game to repel a stronger country that had invaded .
40 employees of the state oil company participated in a similar exercise with 1200 soldiers in 050600 .
Pro - <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> circles here warn of asymmetrical warfare .
Asymmetrical warfare is a term coined by <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> military strategists to describe a conflict between unequal combatants where the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government has given <MONEY>$ 3.3 billion</MONEY> in mostly military aid to <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> in the past 5 years .
Chavez loyalists fear that the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government could instigate a proxy war between <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> as a way to oust <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> and control Venezuelan oil .
A senior <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> official in an interview dismissed the notion that the <ORGANIZATION>United States Government</ORGANIZATION> wants to invade <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> as complete and utter nonsense .
The official said the chavista side wishes to make the relationship negative because they 've made a political calculation that Mr. <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> reached power by constantly being in confrontation with the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> .
Another development that has troubled the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> 's rollback of military cooperation and joint exercises .
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> military had a <ORGANIZATION>Cooperation Office</ORGANIZATION> for 50 years in a <LOCATION>Venezuelan Fort</LOCATION> .
Chavez shut it down in 040000 .
5 <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> military trainers and students participating in an exchange program were ordered to leave the country in 050400 .
Analysts say that it is likely <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> is trying to indoctrinate his public and armed forces .
Analysts say that there is no proof that <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> will use those forces to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere .

The North Korean government may be prepared to begin shutting down a plutonium producing reactor in <DATE>June 2007</DATE> as the first step toward disabling the Unit by <DATE>December 2007</DATE> .
Assistant Secretary of <ORGANIZATION>State Christopher Hill</ORGANIZATION> stated on 18 <DATE>June 2007</DATE> that the North Korean government may be prepared to begin shutting down a plutonium producing reactor in <DATE>June 2007</DATE> as the first step toward disabling the Unit by <DATE>December 2007</DATE> .
Hill is the head American negotiator on <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> 's nuclear weapons program .
Hill stated stalled efforts to dismantle <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> 's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the <DATE>weekend of 16 June 2007</DATE> and 17 <DATE>June 2007</DATE> when <LOCATION>Pyongyang</LOCATION> officials invited inspectors from the <ORGANIZATION>International Atomic Energy Agency</ORGANIZATION> to visit for talks on verifying and monitoring a shutdown .
Following talks with Chinese negotiator <PERSON>Wu Dawei Hill</PERSON> stated the shutdown has long been anticipated .
Hill stated the shutdown could occur in a matter of weeks not months .
The <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> reported from <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> stated on 18 <DATE>June 2007</DATE> that a team would visit <LOCATION>Pyongyang</LOCATION> <DATE>the week of 24 June 2007</DATE> to discuss the manner in which inspectors will verify the shutdown .
Hill stated <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION> inspectors will hold talks with <LOCATION>Pyongyang</LOCATION> officials on sealing the reactor which would include the installation of television monitors at the site .
North Korean officials refused to proceed with a <DATE>February 2007</DATE> agreement to begin decommissioning the <LOCATION>Yongbyon</LOCATION> reactor until funds worth <MONEY>25 million dollars</MONEY> in accounts linked to <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> held in a <LOCATION>Macao Bank</LOCATION> were transferred to <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> .
The money was frozen when officials from the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> accused the <LOCATION>Banco Delta Asia</LOCATION> of complicity in financial crimes on behalf of <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> .
The funds were wired on 14 <DATE>June 2007</DATE> to the <ORGANIZATION>New York Federal Reserve Bank</ORGANIZATION> after months of disagreement over the method of returning the funds .
The funds were to be sent to <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> before a transfer to an account controlled by the <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> government in a Russian commercial bank .
Hill stated talks will occur the week of 17 <DATE>June 2007</DATE> with disarmament negotiators from <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> on steps to recoup some of the time lost while the financial transfer was being organized .
The discussions will also involve setting a timetable for resumption of 6 - nation arms control talks .
Under the agreement reached in <DATE>February 2007</DATE> North Korean officials pledged to shut down the <LOCATION>Yongbyon</LOCATION> reactor and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for a 50000 - ton shipment of fuel oil .
North Korean officials will declare all nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for a further 950000 tons of fuel oil in the next phase of the Agreement .
Hill stated the technical possibility of concluding the next phase of the agreement by <DATE>December 2007</DATE> .

The official website of <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> 's Shiite leader the Grand <PERSON>Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani</PERSON> was among the websites defaced and blocked .

Somali pirates who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms are approaching a deal for the ship 's release .
Questions have emerged regarding the shipment of arms en route to <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> and of a possible clandestine arms deal between <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Sudan</LOCATION> .
On 08 <DATE>October 2008</DATE> Maritime officials and associates of the Somali pirates who on 25 <DATE>September 2008</DATE> hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms stated that the pirates may soon be collecting their ransom .
After difficult negotiations likened by several people involved to bazaar - style haggling the parties are close to reaching a deal in which the pirates would be paid <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> and the ship freed .
A businessman in <LOCATION>xarardheere</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> named Ahmed Omar stated that the pirates and the ship owners have agreed on a ransom of approximately <MONEY>8 million</MONEY> <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollars and the ship may be freed on 08 <DATE>October 2008</DATE> or 09 <DATE>October 2008</DATE> .
Xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on the coast of <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> .
Maritime officials in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> stated that critical details have yet to be agreed upon .
One such detail involves the pirates ' request for a guarantee that they would not be arrested or attacked by the armada of American warships currently encircling them .
A Kenyan maritime official stated anonymously that such negotiations are complex and involve more than the financial aspect .
On 08 <DATE>October 2008</DATE> the official stated that progress is being made and the parties are approaching an agreement .
The pirates initially requested 35 million <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollars and then reduced their request to <MONEY>20 million U.S. dollars</MONEY> .
The pirates have consistently expressed willingness to negotiate the financial figures .
More than 25 ships have been hijacked in <DATE>2008</DATE> off the <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> coast with a typical ransom of between 1 and <MONEY>2 million U.S. dollars</MONEY> .
The pirates aboard the Ukrainian ship have stated that upon receipt of payment in American dollars and preferably in 100 dollar bills the ship , its cargo and the 20 sailors on board will be released .
The original country of destination for the arms shipment aboard the Ukrainian ship is being questioned .
Shortly after the freighter was hijacked on 25 <DATE>September 2008</DATE> the Kenyan government claimed that the weapons on board were being shipped for <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> 's military .
The ship was en route to <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> 's main port of <LOCATION>Mombasa</LOCATION> .
The weapons on board the ship included 33 T - 72 tanks , 150 grenade launchers , 6 anti - aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition .
Evidence has subsequently emerged that the weapons were part of a clandestine arms deal between <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> and the separatist region of southern <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> .
The deal would most likely have remained secret had the pirates not hijacked the ship and begun speaking to the media by satellite phone .
Ukrainian officials have been adamant in denying any wrongdoing .
Ukrainian diplomat in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> oleh belokolos stated --
<LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> does not supply or have plans to supply any armaments to the Government of <LOCATION>South Sudan</LOCATION> .
All the appropriate paperwork has been validated .
<LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> abides by all <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> rules and arms control agreements .
<LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> inherited enormous stockpiles of weaponry after the collapse of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and is now a major arms dealer .
The deal with <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> is considered suspicious given that <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> has mostly relied on the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> and other western countries for its supply of heavy weapons .
Kenyan politicians were demanding answers and have called for several commissions to examine the situation .
Southern <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> is an autonomous region that is currently increasing its military and that uses Soviet - designed tanks .
The American military stated that its priority is to ensure that the weapons were not unloaded from the ship and sold to Islamist insurgents in <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> .
The pirates have denied interest in the weapons and claimed to have been unaware that the cargo included tanks when they hijacked the ship .
Pirate spokesman sugule Ali stated in an interview last week that the pirates ' sole interest in the deal is money .

Head of the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> drug office <ORGANIZATION>Antonio Maria Costa</ORGANIZATION> said that <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency .
Costa said this to reporters last week as the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Drug Office Office</ORGANIZATION> prepared to release its latest survey of <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> 's opium crop .
The survey showed that poppy cultivation had retreated in much of <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> and was overwhelmingly concentrated in 7 of 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strong , most of those in the south .
The survey was issued <DATE>November 27 , 2008</DATE> .
The <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> found that the result was a <PERCENT>19 percent</PERCENT> reduction in the amount of land devoted to opium in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> even though the total tonnage of opium produced dropped by just <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> .
The study stated that the high output per acre was attributed to a good growing season in the south .
The southern region is a heavily irrigated area where the Taliban maintained a strong presence in 5 provinces and have systematically encouraged opium cultivation as a way to finance their insurgency for several years .
The <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> estimates the insurgents made as much as <MONEY>300 million dollars</MONEY> from the opium trade last year .
Costa said a lot of war effort can be funded with 2 to <MONEY>300 million dollars</MONEY> .
The Taliban have producing an amount of opium that far exceeds world demand due to 3 successive years of bumper crops .
Costa said the result was a glut that was depressing the price , which dropped by approximately <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> .
Costa said that the fact that prices had not collapsed already was evidence that the Taliban , drug lords and even some farmers have stockpiled the opium .
An increasing amount is also being processed in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> .
Costa added that insurgents have been holding significant amounts of opium .
Costa said the surplus is as much as 11000 tons , or more than twice world demand in the <DATE>last 3 years</DATE> and threatened to devalue their stockpiles .
The <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> found that <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> produced <DATE>8500</DATE> tons of opium in <DATE>2008</DATE> .
World demand was estimated at about <DATE>4400</DATE> tons per year .
The Taliban this year are taking a passive stance toward cultivation and putting less pressure on Afghan farmers to plant opium poppy .
This then supports the current price .
Costa is an Italian diplomat who has served at the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Office on Drugs</ORGANIZATION> and Crime for 6 years .
